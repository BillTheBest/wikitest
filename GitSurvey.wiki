<pre><nowiki>#!CSV
     Count;Summary;Detail
     28;too many commands;The "too many commands" usually because mixing of porcelain commands and low-level commands. Also there are complaints about too many command options, some doesn't have enough documentation such as git-diff-*
     19;index;there is a suggestion to refer it as "cache" for easier understanding. Another mentioned about the index manipulation after a "git reset --soft".
      8;merge; and merge conflict, why merge fails

      1;;Understanding where the patch repositories are located, and how to determine patch order. 
      1;;The fact git will let you destroy your work trivially, the poor design of the merge system.
      1;;Still not confidant in doing anything other than cloning
      1;;how to reorder fixes and cherrypick fixes from my other temporary git trees
