== Directions ==
Its up to you to get to Google each day.  You may want to try and carpool with other attendees staying at nearby hotels.

When mapping driving directions you want to use [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1500+Plymouth+St,+Mountain+View,+CA+94043&sll=37.420123,-122.08592&sspn=0.010123,0.011952&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=17 1500 Plymouth St, Mountain View, California] as the building street address.

The meeting space, Palomar Tech Talk, is on the second floor of the Plymouth 1 building.

''Parking:'' Any parking that is not otherwise reserved for the disabled, expectant mothers, etc., is fair game.  Help yourself.

''Sign In:'' You will need to sign in at reception each day. You will be asked by our system to execute an NDA, which covers anything you may learn about Google during the course of your visit, not the content of the [[GitTogether]]. If you feel strongly about not executing the NDA, you can go right ahead and decline it during sign in. You won't be that close to employee areas, so I don't care if you sign it or not.

''Photos:'' Nope. Outside only. Be good.

''Recording:'' Audio only, no video. Be good.  Since this is a standard Google tech talk room, we may be able to take advantage of the video recording capabilities to record a specific talk or two and post them on [http://www.youtube.com/ YouTube] after the event.

== Misc. ==
Plenty of table space and power outlets will be available in the meeting room.  Folks outside the US may need to bring an outlet adapter/voltage converter.  Please make sure to bring your laptop power supply.  Unlike most Google conference rooms our meeting space does not come with built-in laptop power connectors.  Even Googlers need to bring their own power supply.

Google has free wireless Internet access available everywhere on the campus ("GoogleGuest").  802.11 wireless support is required to connect to the Internet.  Hardwired LAN connections are not available in our meeting space.

== Travel Details ==
Google provides some [http://code.google.com/events/visitors/ information] about discounted lodging, visiting and parking.

Public transit is available in the area, look at [http://www.google.com/transit Google Transit] to help you plan a route.

If you would prefer to spend less than you would on taxi service but would prefer to be picked up at the airport rather than navigate public transport, try [http://www.supershuttle.com/ Super Shuttle]. Shared rides (with a van full of other travelers) start at about 35 USD from any of the area airports.
