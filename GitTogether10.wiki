''October 25(Mon)-27(Wed) in [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1500+Plymouth+St,+Mountain+View,+CA+94043&sll=37.420123,-122.08592&sspn=0.010123,0.011952&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=17 1500 Plymouth St, Mountain View, California]'' (day after the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit).

Signup deadline is Oct 12th.  Google needs a final guest list by then to prepare badges, sign in lists for reception, and a final head-count to plan for food.

Any questions, please contact Shawn Pearce ( gsoc@spearce.org ).

== Attendees ==
# Shawn O. Pearce
# Rob Heittman
# Nasser Grainawi
# Martin Fick
# Andrew Bayer

Google has us capped at ~30 attendees.

Please join the [http://lists.utsl.gen.nz/mailman/listinfo.cgi/gittogether GitTogether mailing list].  We promise to keep the traffic low and only about this event. Useful information for attendees will be sent to this list as we get closer to the [[GitTogether]].

== Approximate Agenda ==

''TBD''

Please try to time your arrival to the 9:00-9:30 am window each day.  Googlers will be on hand to help you sign in and find the meeting room.  After 9:30 sign-in will get a little bit more interesting as you may need to work with main reception.

Breakfast and lunch each day will be catered by Google.

Dinners:
* Dinner on Monday: To be planned, probably at a local restaurant at your own expense.
* Dinner on Tuesday: To be planned, probably at a local restaurant at your own expense.
* Dinner on Wednesday is not pre-arranged.

== Suggested Topics ==

Please propose a topic by adding it to the table below.

|  ''Kind of session'' 
|  ''Title'' 
|  ''Talk Length''

== Directions ==
Its up to you to get to Google each day.  You may want to try and carpool with other attendees staying at nearby hotels.

When mapping driving directions you want to use [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1500+Plymouth+St,+Mountain+View,+CA+94043&sll=37.420123,-122.08592&sspn=0.010123,0.011952&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=17 1500 Plymouth St, Mountain View, California] as the building street address.

The meeting space, Palomar Tech Talk, is on the second floor of the Plymouth 1 building.

''Parking:'' Any parking that is not otherwise reserved for the disabled, expectant mothers, etc., is fair game.  Help yourself.

''Sign In:'' You will need to sign in at reception each day. You will be asked by our system to execute an NDA, which covers anything you may learn about Google during the course of your visit, not the content of the [[GitTogether]]. If you feel strongly about not executing the NDA, you can go right ahead and decline it during sign in. You won't be that close to employee areas, so I don't care if you sign it or not.

''Photos:'' Nope. Outside only. Be good.

''Recording:'' Audio only, no video. Be good.  Since this is a standard Google tech talk room, we may be able to take advantage of the video recording capabilities to record a specific talk or two and post them on [http://www.youtube.com/ YouTube] after the event.

== Misc. ==
Google will be serving breakfast and lunch each day, in addition to coffee and beverages during the event.  We will arrange for dinner off-campus, at our own expense.

Plenty of table space and power outlets will be available in the meeting room.  Folks outside the US may need to bring an outlet adapter/voltage converter.  Please make sure to bring your laptop power supply.  Unlike most Google conference rooms our meeting space does not come with built-in laptop power connectors.  Even Googlers need to bring their own power supply.

Google has free wireless Internet access available everywhere on the campus ("GoogleGuest").  802.11 wireless support is required to connect to the Internet.  Hardwired LAN connections are not available in our meeting space.  If you think you'll want to get online during the sessions please test your wireless to make sure it is working before you travel.

== Travel Details ==
