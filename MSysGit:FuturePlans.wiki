<!-- #summary Some ideas for interested parties -->

== Future plans ==

There are no concrete future plans. Whatever you want to work on, just do it, and do not forget to have fun.

If you run the danger of getting bored, you might want to have a look over the [http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/issues/list bug reports] and help.

Or you might want to give [[MSysGit:GitCheetah|Git-Cheetah]] a go and improve it.

Or get Python compiled on msysGit. Or a new Subversion.
