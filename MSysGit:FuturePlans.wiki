<!-- #summary Some ideas for interested parties -->

== Future plans ==

The plan is to attract enough Windows developers so that several lieutenants can be assigned for tasks such as

* "make and maintain an easy-to-use installer" (this position is competently held by Steffen; with support from Sebastian),
* "handle bug reports efficiently", and even
* "build and maintain GitCheetah" (the beginnings of which are already progressing, in http://repo.or.cz/w/git-cheetah.git/).

Note: there are a few contenders to GitCheetah, which took the unfortunate path of starting with software that is more tuned to the Subversion way to do things.  However, our hope is still that GitCheetah will become the standard tool.
