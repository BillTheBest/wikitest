This section describes various ways to specify what revisions you are
interested in. Aside from being used by git-log(1), they may also be used
with graphical frontends such as [[gitk]]

= Limit by Path Name =

If you are interested only in those revisions that made changes
to a specific file (or even several files) list the files like this: <pre><nowiki>
$ git log Makefile README
</nowiki></pre>

To avoid ambiguity between repository references, such as tag name,
and filenames, separate file names from other git options using `--`.
So if you have a file named master it will clash with the reference
named master, and thus you will have to use: <pre><nowiki>
$ git log -- master
</nowiki></pre>

= Limit by Date or Number =

You can limit the amount of history to show from a given revision.
Either limit by date using e.g. `--since=1.month` or limit by
the number of commits using `-n400`.

If you are only interested in changed that happened between two dates
you can use: <pre><nowiki>
$ git log --after="May 5th" --before="2006-05-16 15:44"
</nowiki></pre>

<b>Note:</b>
    If you want to avoid having to quote dates containing spaces you can
    use "." instead, e.g. `--after=May.5th`.

= Limiting by Commit Ranges =

Often you are interested in what happened between two revisions, such as
between two releases. For this reason, commits can be limited to a specific
range, such as "all commits between tag-1.0 and tag-2.0". For example: <pre><nowiki>
$ git log tag-1.0..tag-2.0
</nowiki></pre>

This way of commit limiting makes it trivial to only browse the commits
which haven't been pushed to a remote branch. Assuming origin is your
upstream remote branch, using: <pre><nowiki>
$ git log origin..HEAD
</nowiki></pre>
will list what changes are pending to be pushed to the remote branch.
Optionally, the ending `HEAD` can be left out since it is implied.

= Limiting by Reachability =

Git interprets the range specifier "tag-1.0..tag-2.0" as "all commits
reachable from tag-2.0 but not from tag-1.0". Where reachability refers
to what commits are ancestors (or part of the history) of the branch or
tagged revision in question. If you prefer to specify which commits you
are interested in this way use the following: <pre><nowiki>
$ git log tag-2.0 ^tag-1.0
</nowiki></pre>

You can think of `^` as a negation operator. Using this alternate syntax,
it is possible to further prune commits by specifying multiple "cut offs".

= Combining Revision Specifications =

Revisions options can to some degree be combined, which makes it possible
to say "show at most 20 commits from within the last month that changed
files under the Documentation/ directory." <pre><nowiki>
$ git log --since=1.month -n20 -- Documentation/
</nowiki></pre>

= Examining All Repository References =

In some cases, it can be useful to query changes across all references
in a repository. This is especially useful if you are using a visualization
tool such at [[gitk]]. An example is to query "did any line of development
in this repository change a particular file within the last week?"
This can be accomplished using: <pre><nowiki>
$ gitk --all --since=1.week -- Makefile
</nowiki></pre>
