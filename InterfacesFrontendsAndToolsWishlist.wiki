<b>Trac</b> (bugtracker/wiki/history browser)::
    [http://www.edgewall.com/trac/ Trac] is a popular integrated history browser/wiki/bug tracker, which has very recently grown a plugin interface that lets it work with VCS-es besides Subversion. The right place to start is probably the [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/TracMercurial [[TracMercurial]] plugin], since Mercurial uses the same history model as Git. <i>(Python)</i>

<b>DVC (Distributed Version Control)</b> (Emacs interface)::

<b>Eclipse</b> (IDE):: 
    [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] -- a well known, extremely pluggable IDE. Might be useful to look at the [http://eclipsedarcs.org/doku.php Darcs plugin] or [http://www.eclipse.org/community/team.php other existing VCS] plugins. Currently one can work with Eclipse using CVS plugin and `git-cvsserver`. One wonders if one can use `git-svn` and [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Subclipse] (Subversion plugin) instead... <i>(Java)</i>

<b>PIDA</b> (IDE)::
    [http://pida.berlios.de/ PIDA] Integrated development environment supporting CVS, Subversion, Darcs, Mercurial, Monotone, Bazaar-NG (<i>bzr</i>), GNU Arch. It allows embedding Vim or any editor. <i>(Python, GTK)</i>

<b>Meld</b> (merge tool)::
    [http://meld.sourceforge.net/ Meld] is a general diff, merge, and history browsing tool written in Python for GNOME. Has CVS, Subversion, Bazaar-NG and Monotone support. Perhaps [http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/ KDiff3] should also have some VCS support... <i>(Python, GNOME)</i>
