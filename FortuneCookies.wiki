* Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. <i>(Eric S. Raymond, aka Linus' Law)</i>
* I'm basically a very lazy person who likes to get credit for things other people actually do. <i>(Eric S. Raymond)</i>
* We all know Linux is great: it does infinite loops in 5 seconds. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* "I name all my projects after myself: first 'Linux', now 'git'". <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix your program. <i>(Linux 1.3.53 CodingStyle documentation)</i>
* You know you're brilliant, but maybe you'd like to understand what you did 2 weeks from now. <i>(Linux 1.3.53 CodingStyle documentation)</i>
* ... the Linux philosophy is 'laugh in the face of danger'. Oops. Wrong one. 'Do it yourself'. That's it. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* Talk is cheap. Show me the code. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* Those that can, do. Those that can't, complain.
* "Regression testing"? What's that? If it compiles, it is good, if it boots up it is perfect. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>

* I like colorized diffs, but let's face it, those particular color choices will make most people decide to pick out their eyes with a fondue fork. (...) So in order to avoid a lot of blind git users, please apply this patch. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* Case <b>does</b> matter. Anybody who claims otherwise is a total idiot. And no, e e cummings is not an example to the contrary. Quite the reverse. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* ... and if it wasn't clear, "helping" CVS users is not in my opinion to try to make git act like CVS, and lettign them do stupid things, but to try to help them become <b>more</b> than CVS users. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* The people will complain. On this list. And I have to check the mails before deleting, because the Subject: does not say "I just took the rope, ignored your caveat emptor, and now I am dead. What should I do now?". <i>(Johannes Schindelin)</i>
* In related news: there is really no question that bike sheds should be painted red. Really. <i>(Johannes Schindelin)</i>
* P.S.: Linus paid for his Caps Lock key, so he might as well use it. <i>(Johannes Schindelin)</i>
* By "mutual agreement" I mean that I tell you what it looks like and you agree :) <i>(Robin Rosenberg)</i>
* To be fair, there are uses for XML.  On Halloween, for example.  <i>(Johannes Schindelin)</i>
* We could put up some commercials [on git homepage] as well and use them for funding pizza distributed in a round-robin fashion between the developers. <i>(Petr "Pasky" Baudis)</i>
* Repeat after me: in git, *everything* is a SHA1 object! <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* ... where "core git" originally was about "what I use" and the whole "porcelain" side ends up being "what people who need hand-holding use" ;) <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>

* Writing a BitKeeper replacement is probably easier at this point than getting its license changed. <i>(Matt Mackall)</i>
* Welcome to FOSS revolution: we fix and modify until it shines
