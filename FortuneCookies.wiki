* Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. <i>(Eric S. Raymond, aka Linus' Law)</i>
* I'm basically a very lazy person who likes to get credit for things other people actually do. <i>(Eric S. Raymond)</i>
* We all know Linux is great: it does infinite loops in 5 seconds. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* "I name all my projects after myself: first 'Linux', now 'git'". <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix your program. <i>(Linux 1.3.53 CodingStyle documentation)</i>
* You know you're brilliant, but maybe you'd like to understand what you did 2 weeks from now. <i>(Linux 1.3.53 CodingStyle documentation)</i>
* ... the Linux philosophy is 'laugh in the face of danger'. Oops. Wrong one. 'Do it yourself'. That's it. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* Talk is cheap. Show me the code. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* Those that can, do. Those that can't, complain.
* "Regression testing"? What's that? If it compiles, it is good, if it boots up it is perfect. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work done. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* See, you not only have to be a good coder to create a system like Linux, you have to be a sneaky bastard too. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>

* I like colorized diffs, but let's face it, those particular color choices will make most people decide to pick out their eyes with a fondue fork. (...) So in order to avoid a lot of blind git users, please apply this patch. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* Case <b>does</b> matter. Anybody who claims otherwise is a total idiot. And no, e e cummings is not an example to the contrary. Quite the reverse. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* ... and if it wasn't clear, "helping" CVS users is not in my opinion to try to make git act like CVS, and lettign them do stupid things, but to try to help them become <b>more</b> than CVS users. <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* The people will complain. On this list. And I have to check the mails before deleting, because the Subject: does not say "I just took the rope, ignored your caveat emptor, and now I am dead. What should I do now?". <i>(Johannes Schindelin)</i>
* In related news: there is really no question that bike sheds should be painted red. Really. <i>(Johannes Schindelin)</i>
* Hmm, I don't think I've even <b>noticed</b> a real bike shed in decades.  Perhaps they should be painted purple with yellow polkadots and have the words "BIKE SHED" on a flashing neon sign. <i>(Eric Wong)</i>
* P.S.: Linus paid for his Caps Lock key, so he might as well use it. <i>(Johannes Schindelin)</i>
* By "mutual agreement" I mean that I tell you what it looks like and you agree :) <i>(Robin Rosenberg)</i>
* To be fair, there are uses for XML.  On Halloween, for example.  <i>(Johannes Schindelin)</i>
* We could put up some commercials [on git homepage] as well and use them for funding pizza distributed in a round-robin fashion between the developers. <i>(Petr "Pasky" Baudis)</i>
* Repeat after me: in git, *everything* is a SHA1 object! <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* ... where "core git" originally was about "what I use" and the whole "porcelain" side ends up being "what people who need hand-holding use" ;) <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* For example, try doing the timings after flushing the disk caches [...] Or do it over NFS.  Yes, even the "fast" case will actually be painfully slow (well, it is for me, people who are used to CVS probably think it's just "normal"). <i>(Linus Torvalds)</i>
* Linus constantly says that he prefers tools that he can figure out why they did something stupid over tools that try really hard to get it right, and I agree with him 100%, as do most of the core contributors (insofar as I've understood it). <i>(Andreas Ericsson)</i>

* Git is a lot like C. It's incredibly flexible and powerful but it is also incredible flexible and powerful. <i>(Masukomi)</i>
* If you want to shoot yourself in the foot Git will point you to the gun rack and show you how to load the bullets. <i>(Masukomi)</i>
* And then there’s `git rebase --interactive`, which is a bit like `git commit --amend` hopped up on acid and holding a chainsaw -- completely insane and quite dangerous but capable of exposing entirely new states of mind. <i>(Ryan Tomayko)</i>
* Then somebody insisted that all future projects would use CVS. (...) It had quite clearly evolved via the <b>Sticky-Tape and String school of software development</b>, but it worked pretty well [compared to Visual Source Safe]. <i>(Dan Dyer)</i>.
* “Visual SourceSafe? It would be safer to print out all your code, run it through a shredder, and set it on fire.” <i>(Attributed to an unidentified Microsoft employee)</i>.
* Meanwhile, there are many happy Visual SourceSafe users (really, there are -- I've met some, they are nice people despite this) who find the idea of a non-exclusive locking source control system to be the very definition of chaos. <i>(Derek Slager)</i>
* The palest ink is better than the best memory. <i>(Chinese proverb)</i>

* Writing a BitKeeper replacement is probably easier at this point than getting its license changed. <i>(Matt Mackall)</i>
* Welcome to FOSS revolution: we fix and modify until it shines.
* We  reject  kings, presidents,  and  voting.  We  believe in rough consensus and running code. <i>(Dave Clark, 1992 IETF meeting)</i>
* I've never met a human being who would want to read 17,000 pages of documentation, and if there was, I'd kill him to get him out of the gene pool. <i>(Joseph Costello)</i>
* The world of technical support is like a reflecting pool. To those who exist outside, it appears to be a deep, mystical place; bottomless, terrifying, foreign. The truth, however, is that the pool is only about three feet deep, and the bottom is grainy silt over sharp, hurty rocks.

* Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that, once it is competently programmed and working smoothly, it is completely honest. <i>(Isaac Asimov)</i>
* I am not the only person who uses his computer mainly for the purpose of diddling with his computer. <i>(Dave Barry)</i>
* Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. <i>(Edsger Dijkstra)</i>
* Home computers are being called upon to perform many new functions, including the consumption of homework formerly eaten by the dog. <i>(Doug Larson)</i>
* The good news about computers is that they do what you tell them to do. The bad news is that they do what you tell them to do. <i>(Ted Nelson)</i>
* To err is human - and to blame it on a computer is even more so. <i>(Robert Orben)</i>
* People think computers will keep them from making mistakes. They're wrong. With computers you make mistakes faster. <i>(Adam Osborne)</i>
* Treat your password like your toothbrush. Don't let anybody else use it, and get a new one every six months. <i>(Clifford Stoll)</i>
* Never trust a computer you can't throw out a window. <i>(Steve Wozniak)</i>
