`[[RandomQuot]]e` macro selects random quotes from list items on this page. See also [[HelpOnMacros]].

Here are few tips for new users, or users that don't like to read the manual:

* Edit the [[FortuneCookies]] page to display randomly selected wisdom here.
* Tip: set your pages language with <code><nowiki>#language en</nowiki></code> processing instruction. See also [[HelpOnLanguages]].
* Tip: you can add your favorite pages to your navibar. See your Quicklinks list in [[UserPreferences]].
* Tip: you can search for multiple words, just like Google. See also [[HelpOnSearching]].
* Tip: get email notification when this page change, by clicking <b><<[[GetText]](subscribe)>></b>.
* Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.
* Software is like sex; it's better when it's free.
* We all know Linux is great: it does infinite loops in 5 seconds.
* "I name all my projects after myself: first 'Linux', now 'git'".
* ... where "core git" originally was about "what I use" and the whole "porcelain" side ends up being "what people who need hand-holding use"
* Real Programmers think better when playing Adventure or Rogue.
* If the code and the comments disagree, then both are probably wrong.
* Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon.
* "Never make any mistaeks."
* The first time, it's a KLUDGE! The second, a trick. Later, it's a well-established technique!
* The program isn't debugged until the last user is dead.
* Step #1 in programming: understand people.
* Do one thing and do it well.
* To err is human, to forgive, beyond the scope of the Operating System.
* Testing can show the presense of bugs, but not their absence.
* Case *does* matter. Anybody who claims otherwise is a total idiot. And no, e e cummings is not an example to the contrary.
* The people will complain. On this list. And I have to check the mails before deleting, because the Subject: does not say "I just took the rope, ignored your caveat emptor, and now I am dead. What should I do now?".
* In related news: there is really no question that bike sheds should be painted red. Really.

* By "mutual agreement" I mean that I tell you what it looks like and you agree :)
* To be fair, there are uses for XML.  On Halloween, for example.
