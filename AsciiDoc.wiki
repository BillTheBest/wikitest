From the [http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/ AsciiDoc homepage]:

    [[AsciiDoc]] is a text document format for writing short documents,
    articles, books and UNIX man pages. [[AsciiDoc]] files can be
    translated to HTML and [[DocBook]] markups using the asciidoc(1) command.

Much of the [[GitDocumentation]] is written in [[AsciiDoc]].
