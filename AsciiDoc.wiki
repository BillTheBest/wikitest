From the [[AsciiDoc]] homepage

    [[AsciiDoc]] is a text document format for writing short documents,
    articles, books and UNIX man pages. [[AsciiDoc]] files can be
    translated to HTML and DocBook markups using the asciidoc(1) command.

Its output formats include PDF, ''XHTML'', HTML Help, ''manpage'' or plain text
(the formats used by [[Git]] are emphasized).

Much of the [[GitDocumentation]] is written in [[AsciiDoc]].
