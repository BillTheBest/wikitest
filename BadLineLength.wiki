If you see the following errors:<pre><nowiki>
fatal: protocol error: bad line length character
error: failed to push to 'git.example.com:/Repo/Project.git'
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
</nowiki></pre>
It likely means you have some extraneous characters, info message or something upon loging into ssh in command mode.

to test this, do:<pre><nowiki>
ssh user@git.example.com echo testing commands
</nowiki></pre>
You should only see <code><nowiki>testing commands</nowiki></code> returned.  If there are any other characters, you should eamine your dot shell rc file to find any echo or other commands that may produce output.

Thanks to spearce on #git for the debugging help.
