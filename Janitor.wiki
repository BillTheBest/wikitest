Here are some simple but useful tasks that can be done on the Git source code.

It's a very good way to get started if you want to start working on Git or learning its internals.

Please be sure to read the [http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/SubmittingPatches [[SubmittingPatches]]] document before posting your patches. Also please check that your patches apply by sending them to yourself first and then by using "git apply" on what you received.

* Convert code to use "-q" option

Many git commands have some "-q" or "--quiet" option to make them "quiet". Despite that, a lot of code in git uses ">/dev/null" or "2>/dev/null" with these commands, instead of the "-q" or "--quiet" option.

So it would be a good idea to find such code and change it to use -q option.

* Use time_t for timestamps returned by approxidate() instead of unsigned long. This also affects e.g. OPT_DATE options.
