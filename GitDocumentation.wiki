= Getting started =

If you are new to [[Git]], here are some essential documents that will
give you an introduction to the basic workflows.

* For a quick start,
 [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/tutorial.html the tutorial]
 covers the basics.

* See [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/everyday.html the Everyday Git handbook]
 for a useful minimum set of commands depending on your style of git usage.

* CVS users may also want to read [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/cvs-migration.html git for CVS users].

== Pages in category [[GitDocumentation]] ==
See also the pages in [[CategoryGitDocumentation|[[GitDocumentation]] category]].

* Git glossary ([[GitGlossary|[[GitWiki]] version]], [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/glossary.html HTML version], [http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=git/git.git;a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=Documentation/glossary.txt source via gitweb]) offers an explanation of terminology used.
* An overview of the [[RevisionSpecification]] used by the `git log` command and
 several repository visualizers.

= Other relevant tutorials =

* [[Cogito]] also has an
 [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/docs/introduction.html introduction]
 and a [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/docs/cg-ref.html quick reference] of
 frequently used commands.

* [http://linux.yyz.us/git-howto.html The Kernel Hacker's Git Tutorial]
 by Jeff Garzik may be useful.

* Check [[GitLinks]] for further info (including git-related info on pages of projects using git). 

= Man pages =

Each git command is documented in it's own man page. If the man pages are installed
on your local system running: <pre><nowiki>
$ man git-log
</nowiki></pre>
will give you the man page for the git log command.
[http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git.html git(7)]
serves as an overview of git commands and man pages.

Online versions of the [[Git]] man pages corresponding to the
latest development version can be found at:

* http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/

Similarly, [[Cogito]] man pages are available from:

* http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/docs/

= Howtos and technical documents =

Several howtos exist that describes the workflow for accomplishing
various specific tasks, such as using the post-update hook to rebuild
documentation. Note, these are typically derived from discussions
on the git mailing list and only available in plain text.

* http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/howto/

There also exists a handful of technical documents that describes
lowlevel details on how different parts of git operates. These are
mostly useful for developers. You can find them in the
[http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=git/git.git;a=tree;f=Documentation/technical Documentation/technical]
directory in the git source tree.

= Getting and installing documentation =

You can find all the plain text documentation in the git source tree's
[http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=git/git.git;a=tree;f=Documentation Documentation/]
directory.

In order to build the HTML version of the documentation you need to have [[AsciiDoc]]
version 7.0 or greater installed. Man pages also require that xmlto is installed.

To build and install documentation from the git source code simply
run: <pre><nowiki>
$ make install-doc
</nowiki></pre>

Autogenerated documentation are not in the released tarballs so if you want to
avoid having to install the documentation tools you may choose to
fetch the autogenerated HTML and man pages from the <code><nowiki>html</nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki>man</nowiki></code>
branches in the public git project repository. 
Read [http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=git/git.git;a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=INSTALL INSTALL] 
for more detailed documentation (at the end of the file).
<pre><nowiki>
$ git tar-tree man  > git-man.tar
$ git tar-tree html > git-html.tar
</nowiki></pre>

Many distributions bundle pregenerated documentation with either the git-core
package or in a separate git-doc package. They also should be available from
* http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/ 
in the incoming 1.4.x version.
