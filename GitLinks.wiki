== List of revision control software ==
=== Software using a non-distributed approach ===
* [http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/ CVS] — very stable and built on RCS — the most used but has many limitations.
* [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] (`svn`) — like CVS but without some of its limitations.
* [http://www.perforce.com/ Perforce] (`p4`) — comprehensive SCM capabilities built around a scalable client/server architecture. Free for use in open source projects.

=== Software using a distributed approach ===
* [http://www.bitkeeper.com/ BitKeeper] (`bk`) (was used in Linux kernel development December 1999 - April 2005)
* [http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/ GNU Arch] (`tla`) — the original Arch
* [http://bazaar-vcs.org/ Bazaar] (`bzr`) — written in Python. Fast, supports symlinks and merge-through-renames. Decentralised and easy to use. Can losslessly import Arch, Hg, Svn archives.
* [http://www.venge.net/monotone/ Monotone] — full-decentralized in a P2P way.
* [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/ Mercurial] (`hg`) — written in Python. Extremely fast, lightweight, portable, and easy to use.
* [http://codeville.org/ Codeville] written in Python — Uses an innovative merging algorithm.
* [http://abridgegame.org/darcs/ Darcs] is a decentralized and free revision control system written in the Haskell language can keep track of inter-patch dependencies using a "theory of patches" with roots in quantum mechanics.
* [http://svk.elixus.org/ SVK] is written in Perl — built on top of Subversion to allow distributed commits.

=== Other approaches ===
* [http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt Quilt] is a set of scripts to manage a series of patches by keeping track of the changes each patch makes. [[StGIT]] and [[pg]] are Git version control interface layers provides a Quilt-like patch management functionality in the Git environment.

== Git comparison with other SCMs ==
Only those including [[Git]] as one of the systems.
