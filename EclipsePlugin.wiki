Java GIT/Eclipse GIT (by Shawn Pearce) is a Java GIT library and plugin for [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse IDE].

Roadmap of features: [[EclipsePluginWishlist]]

= News =

Lots of stuff changed, but not yet in a complete enough stage to deserve a version
number of its own. My guess is that this will happen in August. Meanwhile please
try the master branch. It can clone from Eclipse, the commandline client can fetch
and push. (see the inconsistency here?, hence no new version). Changes in the repository
from the command line can be picked up quickly by Eclipse and you can change the baseline
for [[QuickDiff]].

LICENSE CHANGE:
The most interesting change for some people may be the license change. The Eclipse specific
parts are licensed under the EPL, while the generic JGit plumbing is under a three clause BSD
license, which makes it possible to use and distribute with almost any other software.

Current revision is 0.3.1. A copy of the announcement can be found at http://marc.info/?l=git&m=120441907913477&w=2

= FAQ =
* Q: How do you tie the plugin to a project or create a project by cloning a repository?
** A: Use Git (THE Git) to create or clone your repo. Select the project in the navigator and go to the context menu's Team item and below it you will find "Share Project". Select it and the rest is self explanatory.
* Q: How do I install the plugin?
** A: See the README and INSTALL documents in the egit repository.
  - A: or [http://cho.hapgoods.com/wordpress/?p=159 This Excellent Blog Entry]
* Q: Is there an update site?
** A: Not at the moment. Code is included to build an update site, but it has some issues to solve.
* Q: Is the project active?
** A: Depends on what is meant by active. Admitted the progress is slow, mostly because there are very few people involved so far, but the project is certainly not dead (as of February 2008).
* Q: Will there be support for Eclipse 3.4 Ganymede anytime soon?
** A: Eclipse 3.4 is already supported.
