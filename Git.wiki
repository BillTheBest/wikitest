<b>Git</b> is a modern [[distributed version control system]] focused on speed, effectivity and real-world usability on large projects.  More generally, Git can serve as a general tool for directory content tracking.

Git was created by [[Linus Torvalds]] with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across the Net. It is currently maintained by [[Junio C. Hamano]].

= Git Features =
* <b>Strong support for non-linear development.</b>  Git supports rapid and convenient branching and merging, and includes powerful tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history.
* <b>Distributed development.</b> Like BitKeeper and SVK, Git gives each developer a local copy of the entire development history, and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as additional development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch. Repositories can be easily accessed via the efficient Git protocol (optionally wrapped in ssh) or simply using HTTP - you can publish your repository anywhere without any special webserver configuration required.
* <b>Efficient handling of large projects.</b> Git is very fast and scales well even when working with large projects and long histories. It is commonly an order of magnitude faster than most other revision control systems, and several orders of magnitude faster on some operations. It also uses an extremely efficient packed format for long-term revision storage that currently tops any other open source version control system.
* <b>Cryptographic authentication of history.</b> The Git history is stored in such a way that the name of a particular revision (a "commit" in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed. Also, tags can be cryptographically signed.
* <b>Toolkit design.</b> Following the Unix tradition, Git is a collection of many small tools written in C, and a number of scripts that provide convenient wrappers. It is easy to chain the components together to do other clever things.
* <b>Pluggable merge strategies.</b> As part of its toolkit design, git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and manual editing is required. It is thus easy to experiment with new merge algorithms.

Besides providing a version control system, the Git project provides a generic low-level toolkit for tree history storage and directory content management.  Traditionally, the toolkit is called the [[plumbing]].  Several other projects (so-called <i>[[porcelain|porcelains]]</i>) offer compatible version control interfaces -- see the [http://git.or.cz/tools.html related tools page on Git Homepage] and [[InterfacesFrontendsAndTools]] page on this wiki.
