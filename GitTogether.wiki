== Misc. ==

Google will be serving continental breakfast each day, in addition to endless coffee and beverages during the event.  Lunch will be provided each day free of charge in the main cafeteria.  Monday night we will also eat in the main cafeteria, free of charge.  Tuesday we are going to try to arrange dinner off-campus, at a local eatery, at our own expense.  Wednesday we may arrange another dinner off-campus, or eat again at the main cafeteria.  It depends on people's individual schedules.

Plenty of power outlets will be available in the meeting room.  Folks outside the US may need to bring an outlet adapter/voltage converter.  Google has free wireless Internet access available everywhere on the campus.  Wireless support is needed to connect to the Internet.  Don't expect hardwired LAN connections to be available.

== Travel Details ==

Google provides [http://code.google.com/events/visitors/ information] about discounted lodging, visiting and parking. Essentially, once you arrive, tell the attendant that you are there for an event in [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=37.422235,-122.083248&ie=UTF8&t=h&ll=37.422328,-122.083248&spn=0.004473,0.007467&z=17 University Theater in Building 40], and they will direct you to the correct parking lot.  The pin on the map is positioned approximately where University Theater is located within the building.

A cab ride from the airport to a nearby hotel will cost approximately, depending on traffic:

* OAK - 120 USD
* SFO - 80 USD
* SJC - 35 USD

Public transit is available in the area, look at [http://www.google.com/transit Google Transit] to help you plan a route.

If you would prefer to spend less than you would on taxi service but would prefer to be picked up at the airport rather than navigate public transport, try [http://www.supershuttle.com/ Super Shuttle]. Shared rides (with a van full of other travelers) start at about 35 USD from any of the area airports.

== Nearby Activities ==

If you are traveling far and wish to stay some extra time there are many activities in the bay area.

* [http://www.onlyinsanfrancisco.com/ San Francisco] is 45 minutes north of Mountain View.
* [http://www.humboldtredwoods.org/ Redwoods State Park] is a 4 hour drive from San Francisco.
* [http://www.nps.gov/seki/ Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Park] about a 4 hour drive from Mountain View.

= Previous [[GitTogether]] =

One such event happened in 2007 with a few developers.  It was an informal, fun time, but not technical.
