= [[GitTogether]] '09 =

It's not yet decided yet if there will be a [[GitTogether]] in 2009 and when and where it would happen.
Please list bellow the location and date ideas you have. And why they might be good.

=== [[GitTogether]] '09 Location and date ideas ===

* San Francisco area, tentative date: 26th-28th October 2009 (see [http://mid.gmane.org/20090413151808.GT23604@spearce.org Shawn's mail]).  Host: our [http://www.google.com generous friends] in Mountain View (like last year).  If you plan to attend, please fill out the [http://tinyurl.com/coefaq survey].
* Portland, Oregon, in September, during or after [http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon LinuxCon] and/or [http://linuxplumbersconf.org/ Linux Plumbers Conference]:

The [http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon LinuxCon] is scheduled for September 21 - 23 and the [http://linuxplumbersconf.org/ Linux Plumbers Conference] is scheduled for September 23 - 25.

This would hopefully make it easy for many Git users going to the above conferences to come.
