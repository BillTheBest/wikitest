These are events when git developers and users physically meet in the same place.

= Next [[GitTogether]] =

We are currently discussing the possibility of a [[GitTogether]] in 2008.

[http://google.com Google] offered to help us organize it. Thanks to them. 

Some possible dates are:

* October 27(Mon)-28(Tue) in Mountain View, California: that's just after the Google SoC Mentor Summit.
* September 20(Sat)-21(Sun) in Portland, Oregon: that would be just after the [http://linuxplumbersconf.org/ Kernel Plumbers Conference], but it's perhaps too late now.

People who said they are interested to attend so far:

* Junio C. Hamano
* Shawn O. Pierce
* Petr Baudis
* J.H.
* Johannes Schindelin
* Sam Vilain
* David Symonds
* Christian Couder

= Previous [[GitTogether]] =

One such event happened in 2007 with a few developers.
