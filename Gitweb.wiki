= Project description =

<b><i>Gitweb</b></i> is [[Git]] web interface, the one working on [http://www.kernel.org/git/ http://www.kernel.org/git/]. It is written in Perl, and can be used as CGI script, or as mod_perl legacy script (run by ModPerl::Registry handler). It allows to browse git repository (or a set of git repositories) using web browser.

Using gitweb you can browse directory tree at arbitrary revision, view contents of files (blobs), see log or shortlog of given branch, examine commit: its commit message and changes made by given commit.  Gitweb can generate feeds in RSS or Atom format.  You can get given version of a file; if not disabled you can download snapshot of a given version of a project (project tree at given revision).  You can search (if it is not disabled) for commits by an author, added to repository by a comitter, commit with commit message (commit description) which includes some text.

There even exists `git-instaweb` script to setup gitweb and a web server for browsing the local repository.

== Notable forks ==

* [http://git.xmms.se/?p=gitweb-xmms2.git;a=summary gitweb-xmms2] (gitweb with XMMS2 project modifications) by Sham Chukoury. Forked off before gitweb was included in git repository. Extra features (added usually in project specific way) include: committags support (i.e. <u>BUG(nn)</u> is hyperlink to appropriate issue in Mantis bug tracker), syntax highlighting in 'blob' view, generating anchors to function definition with the help of generated on the fly tags file. It implemented snapshot support and had separate CSS file before mainline gitweb.
* [http://repo.or.cz/w/git/repo.git repo.or.cz] (custom gitweb patches) by Petr Baudis. Uses current version of gitweb as base, has all features enabled. Includes extra scripts for creating and managing repositories, and integration with [http://repo.or.cz/w/git-browser.git/ git-browser], graphical history viewer in JavaScript.
* [http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=git/warthog9/gitweb.git;a=summary kernel.org] (gitweb w/ caching) by John 'Warthog9' Hawley. Adds gitweb-specific caching support on top of generic gitweb. Split into many smaller modules.

== Other web interfaces ==

* [http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/ cgit] by Lars Hjemli in C (compiled CGI), uses libgit.a, has builtin caching, fast
* [http://www.grmso.net:8090/ wit] ([http://www.absolutegiganten.org/wit/ download]) by Christian Meder in Python, uses PATH_INFO extensively. <i>(defunct, no longer maintained)</i>
* [http://git.flameeyes.is-a-geek.org/gitarella/ gitarella] ([http://flameeyes.is-a-geek.org/projects#gitarella homepage]) by Flameeyes in Ruby, supports CGI and FastCGI interfaces. Inspired by gitweb.
* [http://dan.chokola.com/wit/ Wit] ([http://dan.chokola.com/software/wit.rhtml homepage]) by Daniel Chokola in Ruby/eRuby. Easy setup, configuration (YAML), and customization (customizable CSS, templates), clean code. 
* [http://zackb.org/git-php/git.php git-php] ([http://code.google.com/p/git-php/ homepage]) by Zack Bartel in PHP. Goals: robust, customizable. Gitweb look-alike.
