= Mailing List =

The best place to talk about Git and get questions answered is usually
the mailing list.  You don't even need to be subscribed to post, just
send an email to:

   git@vger.kernel.org

You can find more official information about the mailing list here:

   http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#git

The list volume is pretty low (from a half dozen to 20 posts a day),
to subscribe send an email to:

   majordomo@vger.kernel.org

With an empty subject line and the words "subscribe git" in the message
body.

= Mailing List Archives =

There are several sites that archive all of the mailing list traffic
so that you can search for discussions that have happened in the past
or read ongoing threads without subscribing:

* nntp://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git

= IRC =

For quick questions or just to hang out with fellow git enthusiasts, join
the #git channel on irc.freenode.net.
