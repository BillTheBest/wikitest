The ranges 'before', 'during' and 'after' refers to official duration of Git User's Survey 2007, from 20 August 2007 to 10 September 2007. Actually they are corrected to take into account the fact that local date on survey's server (or UTC date) might be different from local date on user computer, so duration of survey is taken as from 2007-08-19 to 2007-09-11.

Most responses are from the start of survey, 20 and 21 August (133 and 103 responses respectively).  If anyone is interested I can provide full date by date histogram.

England and Scotland counts as United Kingdom here.  UK / US probablu means United Kingdom (Great Britain) or United States of America.  Table is sorted in alphabetical order.

As one can easily see, slightly less than third of GIT users are in the USA (those who answered this survey).

=== 02. What is your preferred non-programming language? ===

This is multiple answers question, although most people gave only one preferred language.

The question itself is not well formulated, as one can see from the number of answers with computer language, and "not understood" answers.  I am not native English speaker, but there were suggestions to use "natural language" instead of "non-programming language".

Around two third of git users prefer English language, at least for dealing with computers.

Youngest git user who answered this survey is 14 years old, oldest is 74 years old. This is quite a span, I'd say,  The age of 25 got most count (51 answers).

The choices include programming languages used by git.  This is multiple choice question (you can be proficient in more than one programming language).

It look like there is only around 3/4 people proficient in Perl as compared to Python; it looks like Python is more popular. C is most popular; shell is more popular than Perl or Python.  The fewest people are proficient in Tcl/Tk. I'm sorry, git-gui and gitk guys; it looks like not many developers... around 4% of git users.

You can check what are the contributions of each programming language to Git code at [http://www.ohloh.net/projects/278/analyses/latest Git Code Analysis at Ohloh].  In the table below there is shown state on November 2007 (there are also some lines / files I guess wrongly attributed to Assembly and DOS batch script):

<b>Footnotes:</b>
<<[[FootNote]]>>

This was free-form question, and tabularizing answers was quite a work.  It is taken as multiple choice question (for example link to Linus presentation at Google found at Slashdot counts as both "Slashdot" and "Linus presentation at Google" answer).

Other / uncategorized includes for example GoogleTalk IM, 3 answers IIRC.  There was one answer of 'through the CPAN module' (?).

Note that [[GitLinks#head-057cdf07b6c4202733d061096c8ac1aef2f4a232:Linus Torvalds presentation]] at [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2199332044603874737 Google Videos] / [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v4XpnKHJAok8 YouTube] got it's own category, and generated quite a bit of git users.

Nice gaussian curve. Most users find it reasonably easy to use. On the other hand git is not considered easy...

=== 07. What helped you most in learning to use it? ===

<b>TO DO (partial)</b><<BR>>
646 / 683 non-empty responses

Some of the responses:
* documentation (generic)
* man pages
* examples / usage cases in man pages
* everyday GIT, tutorials and user's manual
* wiki examples
* reading mailing list / comp.version-control.git
* people on IRC (not only #git)
* advice from other users / friends / colleagues
* (unofficial) documentation on the web: guides, articles, blogs etc. (Here probably should be a sublist of them, with count)
* a development community and/or its documentation, mailing list
   e.g. WINE wiki, Source Mage GNU/Linux development community
* Google (Google searches)
* helpful error messages
* source code, reading the parts of git in shell script
* cogito
* using git in a live project / experimenting / trial and error<<BR>><i>Example answer:</i>That I was able to just delete the entire repository and start over.  That all my mistakes stayed local and didn't affect upstream repos.
* working on an established project that had documented processes for using git
* writing code for both plumbing and Porcelain<<BR>> writing documentation / tutorial for project / article
* understanding the internal representation of the repository;<<BR} good / simple design, basic principles; understanding concepts
* experience of working in software industry;<<BR>> prior experience with version control systems (GNU Arch, SVN, BK, hg)
* version 1.5 
* gitk, qgit; git-gui

One of more interesting:
* We hired a consultant to give us a tutorial

=== 08. What did you find hardest? ===

<b>TO DO (partial)</b>
596 / 683 non-empty responses

Some of the responses:
* the level of complexity
* user interface: too much / inconsistent commands, too many / cryptic options; distinction between plumbing and porcelain; many ways to do a task; insufficient error messages; 'git <cmd> --help' prints manpage, not concise help summary
* obtuse command messages
* weak porcelain, e.g. git-update-index very central
* git-merge was plumbing
* remote / tracking branches; fetching, pushing and pulling, synchronizing repositories; the fact that push is not an opposite of pull; understanding the difference between committing and publishing
* handling multiple remote repositories
* merge vs rebase, deciding on proper workflow; working with topic branches; modifying a patch series
* merge defaults (which branch gets merged)
* git vs StGIT: slightly different merge conflict handling
* making it work in non-POSIX environments; working with git on case-insensitive and other strange filesystems; compiling on exotic OS, for example AIX; generating man pages
* lack of / bad / outdated / insufficient / badly structured docs; hard to find something in the documentation; git lingo in documentation, documentation for users who know git; using Cogito in some of documentation
* understanding of concepts, thinking in git way; understanding basic concepts and terminology
* distributed SCM concepts, paradigm shift; idea of non-linear history
* index (staging area): understanding, having it visible
* git-diff not showing added files
* commands named differently from equivalents in other SCM; differences from other SCM: git-commit needs '-a' to commit all; changes, strange semantics of git-add, multiple branches in repo; understanding terminology
* importing history from other SCM (bzr, svn)
* reverting changes, amending commit, undoing a commit
* keeping track of where am I, of which version I'm working with finding which branch the change was made on
* lerning to use it as maintainer; maintaining "perfect patch series", keeping history clean; rewritig history before 'git rebase -i'
* dealing with merge conflicts; figuring how to undo failed merge and restart it
* learning conventions git expects but didn't document clearly like commit message formatting
* setting up shared repo / shared server; setting up remote repository
* dealing with modified files (dirty tree) when switching branches, merging (pulling) and rebasing
* checking out past revisions (or tagged revisions) with the intention to return to newer revision
* creating independent branch, i.e. branch without ancestry
* exploring the history and previous versions of particular files, which are renamed and/or moved around, especially before '--follow' was added
* some hot-shot peple in the community (on the mailing list)
* setting up gitweb
* having to use CLI interface
* no <i>some language</i> documentation

More interesting answers:
* All idiosyncrasies that make (made) sense for Linus' workflow but aren't really orthogonal or predictable. 
* Listening to whiners complain about how hard it was to learn
* Thinking outside the narrow box defined by previous SCMs.
* Not having used an SCM before!
* Following the explosive growth of features.
* Having a day job taking most of my time away from git.
* Convincing my boss to use it.

Conclusions:
* some of the things got corrected, like separate remote layout being default for non-bare repositories, using [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-add.html git-add] (porcelain) instead of [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-update-index.html git-update-index] (plumbing) in documentation and command messages, promoting [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html git-merge] to porcelain, creating [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.html git-remote] for managing multiple repositories and remote branches, better documentation including creating [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html Git User's Manual].
* some things are hard because of historical reasons, such like naming of commands, or consistency of options, and would be difficult to change.
* doing things "git way", such as making index visible (and requiring 'git commit -a' to commit changes in all files), or rename detection instead of rename tracking, or storing filenames and file contents 'as-is' (without translation) are I think here to stay
* some of things are intrinsically hard, and would stay that way, for example the distributed SCM concept, or nonlinear history.

<b>NOTE!</b> This table shows <b>only</b> answers in which there was given Git version explicitely. Some people gave date, some people wrote how long they have used git. Those answers needs also processing; they are <i>not presented</i> here.

It looks like the Git users community is divided into part of users who started using it from beginning, or almost from beginning, and users which started using git post v1.3.0 (post e.g. making separate remotes the default layout of branches).
