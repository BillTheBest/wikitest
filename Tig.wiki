= Project description =

Tig is a text-mode interface for git: a git repository browser
that additionally can act as a pager for output of various git commands.
It is written in C using the ncurses.

When browsing repositories, it uses the underlying git commands
to present the user with various views, such as summarized
revision log and showing the commit with the log message, diffstat,
and the diff.

Using it as a pager, it will display input from stdin and try to
colorize it.
