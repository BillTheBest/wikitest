Wit is a Ruby/eRuby web interface to git.

Wit provides:
* more powerful configuration; see the [http://dan.chokola.com/wit/config.yaml easy-to-use YAML configuration]
* easy YAML configuration (no mucking around in Perl!)
* highly customizable; CSS styles are configurable and [http://dan.chokola.com/wit/blob.rhtml?group=Pet%20Projects&name=Wit&branch=master&head=3c2c3e582ef0d341dfeefc275c329d011029ef8c&obj=./index.rhtml very elegant eRuby templates] make creating completely custom pages easy.
* clean code
** no more running through 4000+ lines of obfuscated Perl, there's only a few hundred lines of Wit code anyway
** elegantly object-oriented with Ruby and split into multiple files so your eyes won't bleed and your webserver will love you
* focus on getting information to you quicker without redundancy
** last commit is linked right on the index page
** redundant summary and shortlog views are combined
** commit and diff views are combined
