[http://github.com/dchokola/Wit Wit] is a Ruby/eRuby web interface to git.

Wit provides:
* more powerful configuration; see the [http://github.com/dchokola/Wit/blob/master/config.yaml.example easy-to-use YAML configuration]
* easy YAML configuration (no mucking around in Perl!)
* highly customizable; CSS styles are configurable and [http://github.com/dchokola/Wit/blob/master/index.rhtml very elegant eRuby templates] make creating completely custom pages easy.
* clean code
** no more running through 4000+ lines of obfuscated Perl, there's only a few hundred lines of Wit code anyway
** elegantly object-oriented with Ruby and split into multiple files so your eyes won't bleed and your webserver will love you
* focus on getting information to you quicker without redundancy
** last commit is linked right on the index page
** redundant summary and shortlog views are combined
** commit and diff views are combined
