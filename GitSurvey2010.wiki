<b><font size="large">The "Git User's Survey 2010" has begun.</font></b>

The [https://www.survs.com/survey/MUPYR8UJ4B Git User's Survey 2010] is now up! Please devote a few minutes of your time to fill out the simple questionnaire; it'll help the Git community understand your needs, what you like about Git (and what you don't), and overall help us improve it.

The survey will be open from '''1 September''' to '''15 October, 2010'''.

Have fun!
