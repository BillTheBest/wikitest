Currently GIT is only supported on Windows within a Cygwin environment. While this works well, there are several efforts that aim to provide a more <i>native</i> GIT on Windows.

These efforts are

* EclipseIDE-based GIT client, based on a pure Java implmentation of GIT's internals.
* A libgit + cygwin.dll Windows Explorer extension (perhaps based on TortoiseSVN)

Ask on the [[MailingLists]] for the latest news on this ;-)

= Cygwin =

You will need to install cygwin and the following packages to be able to build git:

* rcs (for merge)
* python (for merge-recursive, though merge-recur is a *huge* win)
* wish (for gitk)
* perl
* ssh
* openssl (and -dev)
* zip (and -dev)
* curl (and -dev)
* expat (and -dev)
* make
* gcc
* binutils (sorta necessary to compile!)

With these packages installed you build git and it in your ~/bin directory by doing:

<pre><nowiki>
make install
</nowiki></pre>

Check that your path includes ~/bin !
