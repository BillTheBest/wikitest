== Gitweb wishlist and TODO list ==

* diffstat in 'commit' and 'commitdiff_plain' views
* summary of number of lines changed in difftree (not for merges)
* configurable committags support (e.g. BUG(n))
* syntax highlighting ('blob' view filter)
* sources indexing/crossreferencing
* graphical history view
* diffs between arbitrary commits, trees, blobs
* 'tree_blame' VievVC-like view (needs core support for performance)
* support for caching engines (Etag/If-None-Match etc.)
* (optional) caching in gitweb
* repository administration (moving branches, signing commits etc.)
* mod_perl specific support
* FastCGI specific support
* native config reading (in Perl) ''or'' "git config --dump" (needs core support)
* project categories
* stat plots (like in [http://statcvs.sourceforge.net/statcvs-stats/ StatCVS] or [http://fisheye.codehaus.org/browse/activecluster FishEye])
* (optional) use Git.pm
* incremental blame (AJAX)
* following renames in 'history' view (needs core support)
* sorting 'tags'/'heads' view
* log (full) and shortlog (short) made into formats, to be used e.g. in 'history' view.
* side by side (graphical) diff
* search checkboxes: ignore case, regexp search
* context specific search (grep in a tree/blob, search starting from commit)

== Granted wishes ==

* show symlinks targets in 'tree' view
* combined diff for merges
