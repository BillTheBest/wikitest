= Presentation =

Git is able to use an external driver which converts the real content of an element into something else, preferably more useful for the user. Thus the git machinery (diff, blame ...) can do its treatment on the converted data. The basic use of this is the manipulation of binary files, with which "git diff" is almost useless.

= How to use =

== driver configuration ==

Drivers must be specified for the files you want to convert.

==== .gitattributes ====

In your working directory, .gitattributes must associate files to a driver:
<pre><nowiki>
<file pattern> diff=<driver_name>
</nowiki></pre>

Here is an example:

<pre><nowiki>
*.odf diff=odf
*.odt diff=odf
*.odp diff=odf
</nowiki></pre>

==== .gitconfig ====

In your home directory, .gitconfig must indicate the command to execute for the given driver:
<pre><nowiki>
[diff "<driver_name>"]
      textconv=<command>
</nowiki></pre>

Here is a continuation of the previous example:

<pre><nowiki>
[diff "odf"]
      textconv=odt2txt
</nowiki></pre>

Please note that, in this case, odt2txt must have been installed.

= Demo =

Let's take an example with the file textconv_demo.odt.

== git blame ==

The command : git blame textconv_demo.odt gives the following result:

<pre><nowiki>
