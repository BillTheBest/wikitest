= Distributed SCM (Software Configuration Management) =

A distributed [[SCM]] tool is designed to support a model in which each repository is loosely coupled to many others. Each repository contains a complete set of metadata describing one or more projects. These repositories may be located almost anywhere. Individual developers only need access to their own repositories, not to a central one, in order to commit changes.

In the distributed approach, each developer works directly with their own local repository, and changes are shared between repositories as a separate step. This mode of operation allows developers to work without a network connection, and it also allows developers full revision control capabilities without requiring permissions to be granted by a central authority. One of the leading proponents of distributed revision control is [[Linus Torvalds]], developer of the Linux kernel. Distributed systems inherently allow multiple simultaneous editing.

Distributed SCMs provide mechanisms for propagating changes between repositories.

Distributed SCMs are in contrast to [[CentralisedSCM]]s.
