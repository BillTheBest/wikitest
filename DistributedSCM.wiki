= Distributed SCM (Software Configuration Management) =

A distributed [[SCM]] tool is designed to support a model in which each repository is loosely coupled to many others. Each repository contains a complete set of metadata describing one or more projects. These repositories may be located almost anywhere. Individual developers only need access to their own repositories, not to a central one, in order to commit changes.

Distributed SCMs provide mechanisms for propagating changes between repositories.

Distributed SCMs are in contrast to [[CentralisedSCM]]s.
