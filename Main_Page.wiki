= Git Wiki =

This is the Git Wiki site. It is a little experimental right now; it is not
currently meant as the primary source of information about [[Git]] but it might
be useful for easy information exchange between users of Git and the Git
[[Porcelain|porcelains]] like [[Cogito]], [http://wiki.procode.org/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi/StGIT StGIT]
and such.  Well, have fun! And as the wiki users say, edit with courage.

The other information sources are the [http://git.or.cz/ Git Homepage] (the
webmaster takes patches) and obviously the stock documentation:
* http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs
* http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/docs

== Getting Help ==
* See the [[GitCommunity]] page for mailing list and IRC information.
* See the [[GitDocumentation]] page for an overview of git related documentation.
* See the [[GitGlossary]] ([http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/glossary.html original]) for explanation of terminology.
* See the [[GitFaq]] page for frequently asked questions.
* See the [[GitTips]] page for tips on how to get the most out of git.

== Wiki Metainformation ==

FYI, a Wikipedia-like link syntax is also supported aside of the [[MoinMoinWiki]]-like one
(since everyone is used to Wikipedia and it's much easier to write):

* You can make links using <code><nowiki>[[linkname]]</nowiki></code> (or even <code><nowiki>[[target|label]]</nowiki></code>; all the other moinmoin ways to make links work as well). The link target's initial letter will be automagically capitalized; if you want to avoid that, use <code><nowiki>[[link]]</nowiki></code>
* If you ever need to use macros here, use a <code><nowiki> <<macroname>> </nowiki></code> syntax.

=== What is this wiki about? ===

Interesting starting points:
* [[RecentChanges]]: see where people are currently working
* [[WikiSandBox]]: feel free to change this page and experiment with editing
* [[Special:Search|FindPage]]: search or browse the database in various ways
* [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing SyntaxReference]: quick access to wiki syntax
* [[Special:Specialpages|SiteNavigation]]: get an overview over this site and what it contains

=== How to use this site ===

A Wiki is a collaborative site, anyone can contribute and share:
* Edit any page by pressing <b><<[[GetText]](Edit)>></b> at the top or the bottom of the page
* Create a link to another page with joined capitalized words (like [[WikiSandBox]]) or with <code><nowiki>[[quoted words in brackets]]</nowiki></code>
* Search for page titles or text within pages using the search box at the top of any page
* See [[HelpForBeginners]] to get you going, [[HelpContents]] for all help pages.
