= Git Wiki =
This is the Git Wiki site. It is a little experimental right now; it is not currently meant as the primary source of information about [[Git]] but it might be useful for easy information exchange between users of Git and the Git [[Porcelain:porcelains]] like [[Cogito]], [http://wiki.procode.org/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi/StGIT StGIT], [http://www.isisetup.ch/ IsiSetup] and such.  Well, have fun! And as the wiki users say, edit with courage.

The other information sources are the [http://git.or.cz/ Git Homepage] (the webmaster takes patches) and obviously the stock documentation:

* http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs
* http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/docs

== Getting Help ==
* Read [[QuickStart]], or even better [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html Git's User Manual]
* See the [[GitCommunity]] page for mailing list and IRC information.
* See the [[GitDocumentation]] page for an overview of git related documentation.
* See the [[GitGlossary]] ([http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/glossary.html original]) for explanation of terminology.
* See the [[GitFaq:FAQ]] page for Frequently Asked Questions.
* See the [[GitTips]] page for tips on how to get the most out of git.

* [[InterfacesFrontendsAndToolsWishlist]] list other programs that we would want to work with Git.
* [[GitBenchmarks]] shows how Git performs and how compares to other version control systems.

== Projects using Git ==
Projects that use [[Git]] for their source code management are listed in [[GitProjects]].

If you search a place to host your git repository, take a look at [[GitHosting]] page.

== Other pages ==
* [[WindowsInstall]] tells how to install Git on MS Windows.
* Check out [[GitRelatedLogos]].

== Getting Involved ==
* Subscribe to the git mailing list (see [[GitCommunity]] page).
* Check out [[Janitor]] page.
* Check out [[ToDo]] page.
* Google [[SoC2007Ideas:Summer of Code 2007]] and Google [[SoC2008Ideas:Summer of Code 2008]] and project ideas.

== Unrelated "Git" projects ==
Unfortunately, the project name Git is overloaded. At least two unrelated projects exist which provide
commands named git. These should be uninstalled (or renamed) to use this git.
* [http://hulubei.net/tudor/git/ Git (GNU Interactive Tools)] is a set of browsing and viewing tools
* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/git Git (Guitar/Instrument Tuner)] is a defunct portable guitar tuner.

== Wiki Metainformation ==
FYI, a Wikipedia-like link syntax is also supported aside of the [[MoinMoinWiki]]-like one (since everyone is used to Wikipedia and it's much easier to write):

* You can make links using <code><nowiki>[[linkname]]</nowiki></code> (or even <code><nowiki>[[target|label]]</nowiki></code>; all the other moinmoin ways to make links work as well). The link target's initial letter will be automagically capitalized; if you want to avoid that, use <code><nowiki>[[link]]</nowiki></code>
* If you ever need to use macros here, use a <code><nowiki> <<macroname>> </nowiki></code> syntax.
=== What is this wiki about? ===
Interesting starting points:

* [[RecentChanges]]: see where people are currently working
* [[WikiSandBox]]: feel free to change this page and experiment with editing
* [[Special:Search|FindPage]]: search or browse the database in various ways
* [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing SyntaxReference]: quick access to wiki syntax
* [[Special:Specialpages|SiteNavigation]]: get an overview over this site and what it contains
=== How to use this site ===
A Wiki is a collaborative site, anyone can contribute and share:

* Edit any page by pressing <b><<[[GetText]](Edit)>></b> at the top or the bottom of the page
* Create a link to another page with joined capitalized words (like [[WikiSandBox]]) or with <code><nowiki>[[quoted words in brackets]]</nowiki></code>
* Search for page titles or text within pages using the search box at the top of any page
* See [[HelpForBeginners]] to get you going, [[HelpContents]] for all help pages.
