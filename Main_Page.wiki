Welcome to the [[Git]] wiki web site. This wiki is a community effort to provide an accurate source of information for all things related to [[http://git-scm.com|Git]]. Make sure to visit the Git website for current updates and information. The Git [[http://github.com/schacon/gitscm|web site source]] is also managed using Git. The maintainers of the Git website would love patches for improving the website. It's a great way to try out Git. If you come across anything in this wiki or the Git homepage that needs to be fixed; help yourself and fix it. The more people who help work on this wiki the better this site will serve Git users. Think of this site as a Wikipedia for Git.

Git is not to be confused with at least these two unrelated projects which also provide commands named git. These should be uninstalled (or renamed) to use this git.

* [[http://hulubei.net/tudor/git/|gnuit (GNU Interactive Tools)]] is a set of file browsing and viewing tools (a text-based file manager).
* [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/git|Git (Guitar/Instrument Tuner)]] is a defunct portable guitar tuner.
