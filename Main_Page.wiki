= Git Wiki =

This is the Git Wiki site. It is a little experimental right now; it is not
currently meant as the primary source of information about Git but it might
be useful for easy information exchange between users of Git and the Git
porcelains like Cogito, StGIT and such.  Well, have fun! And as the wiki
users say, edit with courage.

The other information sources are the [http://git.or.cz/ Git Homepage] (the
webmaster takes patches) and obviously the stock documentation:
* http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs
* http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/cogito/docs
