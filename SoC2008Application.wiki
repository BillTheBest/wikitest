<b> Describe your organization. </b>

As Git approaches its second anniversary, it is now the revision
control system of choice for many of the largest and most successful
open source projects, including the Linux kernel and at least five
Google Summer of Code 2006 projects: One Laptop Per Child, Tangram,
The Wine Project, XMMS2, and X.org.  Many more are considering
Git adoption.

This achievement is the product of the Git development community,
a loose-knit team of developers, technical writers, and end users
with a passion for high quality open-source development.

''' Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2008? What
do you hope to gain by participating? '''

Prior Google Summer of Code projects have asked for several new
features in Git, including submodule support (needed by Gentoo) and
a native Windows port (needed by KDE and The Mozilla Foundation).
The future development and maintenance of these and other features
depends on the community's continued ability to attract new
developers.

The Git community has a proven track record of attracting, mentoring
and retaining new contributors, thanks to a welcoming community,
active IRC and mailing list, and developers and leadership with
excellent communication skills and a dedication to explaining
architecture and providing feedback on contributions.  We are
therefore optimistic about our ability to take advantage of GSoC
2007 to attract more long-term contributors.

''' What criteria did you use to select these individuals as
mentors? Please be as specific as possible. '''

All mentors volunteered for the specific project(s) that they could
contribute the most to.  All mentors are active contributers within
the Git development community.

Active contributers are defined to be those who have submitted and
have had accepted into a shipped release a substantial amount of
new code or fixes within the last 4 months (Nov 2006 - Mar 2007).
Substantial amount of code is defined to be equal in size (or
larger) to what might be reasonably expected of a student working
on a Google Summer of Code project.

All mentors are well known within the Git development community
for their accomplishments and contributions.

<b> What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? </b>

Every reasonable effort will be made to maintain contact with
students and ensure they are making progress throughout the summer.

In the unfortunate event that a student abandons and does not
complete his/her GSoC project, the Git community will try to pick up
and continue the work without the student.  This is one reason why we
will require frequent publishing of project materials to repo.or.cz.

Students will also be strongly encouraged by our mentors to work
through their project by completing several small milestones
throughout the summer.  This strategy of project organization will
help students to feel like they have accomplished something useful
sooner, as well as making it easier for the Git community to pick
up an abandoned project.

<b> What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? </b>

Most of our suggested projects have more than one mentor available.
As a community we plan on making sure all of the active projects have
at least two mentors willing and available to work with the student,
reducing the likelihood that the project becomes mentor-less during
GSoC '07.

In the unlikely event that a mentor disappears during the summer
another mentor will be arranged to step in.  The Git community
has plenty of good people within that would be more than happy to
help a student finish their project.  It is very probable that the
replacement mentor would already be familiar with the student and
the project, as many community members routinely review code and
discussions on the mailing list.

''' What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with
your project's community before, during and after the program? '''

Students will be required to join the main development mailing
list, and post their patches for discussion to same.  All current
contributors already do this, so students will see the experienced
hands performing the same tasks, and will therefore be able to learn
by example.  We feel that the list based discussions will help the
students to become, and stay, a member of the community.

Mailing list traffic is currently around 80-100 messages per day,
and is focused on Git feature development.  Keeping current by
at least skimming list messages is an important part of the Git
development process.

Students will be required to post their work as a Git repository on
repo.or.cz (an open community hosting server), or on another publicly
available server, so that their work is immediately available for
everyone to review, experiment with, and make use of.  Nearly all
members of the Git community post their active work to repo.or.cz
or similar servers.

Mentors will also exchange email with students on at least a
weekly basis, if not more frequently.  Students will be required
to provide weekly progress reports back to their mentors, so that
the mentors are aware of the tasks that a student might be stuck on
or are having difficulty with.  The intent of the progress reports
is to give the mentors a chance to provide suggestions for problem
resolution back to the student.

Frequent email and IRC interaction with mentors and other developers
will be strongly encouraged by suggesting students post their
questions and ideas to the mailing list, and to discuss them on #git.
Most developers either already hold "office-hours" on IRC, or have
agreed to do so during GSoC '07.

''' What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with
the project after GSoC concludes? '''

GSoC will be a good introduction to Git (both the technology and the
community) for the students.  Once they know Git and are "hooked",
we are confident they won't easily leave the arena, for a number
of reasons.

The interaction between community members has always been very
friendly, and new people are have always been warmly welcomed;
especially those with interesting new ideas and viewpoints.
Jovial working friendships have been easily formed between the
community members, and students will most certainly also be warmly
welcomed into that environment.

Hacking on Git is an excellent way to hone one's development skills,
as the community is filled with a wide range of very experienced
programmers who are ready and willing to help a contributor improve
the quality of their work.  We hope that students will realize this
unique opportunity during GSoC and continue staying active within
the community even after GSoC '07 completes.
