[[GitBot]] is the bot used in the #git IRC channel on freenode. It's source is also kept in Git and can be found [http://github.com/pieter/gitbot/tree/master on GitHub].

[[GitBot]] is maintained by Pieter de Bie. You can email Pieter at frimmirf@gmail.com. Questions can also be directed to 'Pieter' on freenode.

== Goal ==

[[GitBot]] allows you to scan Git repositories for objects mentioned in an IRC channel. This is useful for referring to a specific commit or file, which can then be viewed online using the link [[GitBot]] provides. Currently, only Gitweb and local repositories are supported. As soon as [[GitHub]] has a suitable API, support for [[GitHub]] will also be added.

== Usage ==

[[GitBot]] works by through a list of provided Git repositories. It can scan this list every time an object is mentioned.

[[GitBot]] can be invoked implicitly by supplying a sha1 of an object, at least 7 characters long. If [[GitBot]] finds such a phrase, it tries to look up the object on all the supplied Git repositories. If it find one, it creates a tinyurl and returns this in the IRC channel:
<pre><nowiki>
23:57 < Pieter> Hey, look how interesting 65c35b2256ecbfaebcf04559fe6070807646afff is!
23:57 < Gitbot> [git 65c35b225]: http://tinyurl.com/6mxgqg -- t7001: fix "git mv" test
</nowiki></pre>

[[GitBot]] can also be invoked explicitly. The syntax is the following:
<pre><nowiki>
    <[Repo] Ref[:Path]>
</nowiki></pre>
Where Repo and Ref are optional. This means that you can refer to the `master` branch by using <code><nowiki><master></nowiki></code> in the IRC channel:
<pre><nowiki>
23:55 < Pieter> <master>
23:55 < Gitbot> [git master]: http://tinyurl.com/68cfzf -- Git.pm: Make File::Spec and File::Temp 
                requirement lazy
</nowiki></pre>

Similarly, <code><nowiki><HEAD:Documentation/githooks.txt></nowiki></code> will supply a link to the newest githooks.txt file.

Using the Repo part, you can specify which repository to look in. For example, you can look up the `README` of Egit: <code><nowiki><egit HEAD:README></nowiki></code>. You can also use URL-like strings to specify repositories that are not in the supplied repository list, for example:
<pre><nowiki>
23:41 < Pieter> <repo:glibc.git HEAD:README>
23:41 < Gitbot> [glibc README]: http://tinyurl.com/6e536k [blob]
</nowiki></pre>
will look up the README on the main branch in the `glibc.git` repository on [repo.or.cz]
