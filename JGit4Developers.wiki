{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"
| <tablewidth="1197px" tableheight="291px" tablealign="">org.spearce.jgit.lib
| the on disk representation of a repository, reading/writing that data.
| 
|-
| org.spearce.jgit.transport
| network connectivity to push or fetch to another local or remote repository.
| 
|-
| org.spearce.jgit.revwalk
| steps through the commit graph, like git-rev-list or similiar tools such as git-log or git-format patch.
| 
|-
| org.spearce.jgit.treewalk
| steps through N trees in parallel, merge-sorting the tree entries by their path names. This is used for computing tree differences where (N > 1) or for enumeration where (N==1)
| 
|-
| org.spearce.jgit.dircache
| handles the.git/index file, reading and writing to it.
| 
|-
| org.spearce.jgit.errors
| Exception classes
| 
|-
| org.spearch.jgit.revplot
| graphics library agnostic commit graphing algorithms. 
| 
|-
| org.spearce.jgit.awtui
| extension of revplot to draw commit graph diagrams using Swing/AWT
| 
|-
| org.spearce.jgit.pgm
| Currently the best example code in the source distribution for a bird's eye view. Start here with little command line tools like Branch, [[LsTree]] and Log.

* The other packages { fnmatch, util, misc } provide generic utility routines that defy classification.
* Stgit is deprecated and may die soon.
* Both revwalk and treewalk have a filter subpackage with a number of functions that can be glued together to perform commit (or tree entry) selection. like --author=, --grep=, etc.
