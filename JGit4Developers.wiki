|-
| org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk

| 
|-
| org.eclipse.jgit.treewalk
| steps through N trees in parallel, merge-sorting the tree entries by their path names. This is used for computing tree differences or merges where (N > 1) or for enumeration where (N==1)
| 
|-

| 
|-
| org.eclipse.jgit.errors
| Exception classes
| 
|-
| org.eclipse.jgit.revplot
| graphics library agnostic commit graphing algorithms.

|-
| org.eclipse.jgit.awtui
| extension of revplot to draw commit graph diagrams using Swing/AWT
| 
|-
| org.eclipse.jgit.pgm
| Currently the best example code in the source distribution for a bird's eye view. Start here with little command line tools like Branch, LsTree and Log.

* The other packages { fnmatch, util, misc } provide generic utility routines that defy classification.
* Stgit is deprecated and may die soon.
* Both revwalk and treewalk have a filter subpackage with a number of functions that can be glued together to perform commit (or tree entry) selection. like --author=, --grep=, etc.
