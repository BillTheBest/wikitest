<<Anchor(--amend)>>
== How to fix the most recent commit ==

Git allows you to easily fix up the most recent commit you've made on
a branch with the --amend option:

For example the following command will allow you to alter 
the commit message at the top of current head:
<pre><nowiki>
$ git commit --amend
</nowiki></pre>
while 
<pre><nowiki>
$ git commit -s --amend
</nowiki></pre>
will let you alter the commit message and will also automatically
add a sign-off message for you.

<<Anchor(rewrite-hist)>>
== How to change commit deeper in history ==

As in Git commits depends on the whole history up to it, fixing not the most recent commit
(commit which is not branch head) requires rewriting history from the changed commit upwards.

You can use [[Cogito]]'s [http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=cogito/cogito-doc.git;a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=txt/cg-admin-rewritehist.1.txt cg-admin-rewritehist(1)] for that.
