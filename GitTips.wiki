<<Anchor(--amend)>>
== How to fix the most recent commit ==

Git allows you to easily fix up the most recent commit you've made on
a branch with the --amend option:

For example the following command will allow you to alter 
the commit message at the top of current head:
<pre><nowiki>
$ git commit --amend
</nowiki></pre>
while 
<pre><nowiki>
$ git commit -s --amend
</nowiki></pre>
will let you alter the commit message and will also automatically
add a sign-off message for you.

<<Anchor(rewrite-hist)>>
== How to change commits deeper in history ==

Since history in Git is immutable, fixing anything but the most recent commit
(commit which is not branch head) requires that the history is rewritten from
the changed commit and forward.

You can use [[Cogito]]'s [http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=cogito/cogito-doc.git;a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=txt/cg-admin-rewritehist.1.txt cg-admin-rewritehist(1)] for that.
