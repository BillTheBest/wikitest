This year Git was fortunate enough to receive funding for 6 students,
and we are looking forward to the successful completion of the
following interesting projects:

== [[GitTorrent]] ==
<b>Student:</b> Joshua Roys <<BR>>
<b>Mentor:</b>  Sam Vilain  <<BR>>

Josh and Sam will be working to implement native git object
transport via a peer-to-peer system, potentially allowing
popular projects such as the linux kernel to be available
via more servers than just git.kernel.org.

== git-statistics ==
<b>Student:</b> Sverre Rabbelier <<BR>>
<b>Mentor:</b>  David Symonds    <<BR>>

Sverre and David are looking to mine the commit history of
a project and identify "good" changes from "bad" changes.
Such information may help maintainers to better judge the
risk associated with new changes, and help new contributers
to more quickly locate individuals who are experienced in
a particular section of code (e.g. automatically identify
module maintainers).

== Gitweb caching ==
<b>Student:</b> Lea Wiemann           <<BR>>
<b>Mentor:</b>  John 'warthog' Hawley <<BR>> 

Lea and John will be working to port the caching gitweb fork
that runs on kernel.org back into the main tree, as well as
implementing even more improved caching for really large sites
like kernel.org, repo.or.cz, or anyone else using gitweb for
a large number of repositories and users.

== Eclipse plugin push support ==
<b>Student:</b> Marek Zawirski  <<BR>>
<b>Mentor:</b>  Shawn O. Pearce <<BR>>

Marek and Shawn will be working to implement pack generation
in jgit, allowing the 100% native Java implementation of Git
to create pack files locally, as well as upload pack files to
a remote repository over the native Git transport.  Marek is
also looking forward to improving some of the user interface
aspects of the Eclipse Git team provider plugin.

== git-merge builtin ==
<b>Student:</b> Miklos Vajna        <<BR>>
<b>Mentor:</b>  Johannes Schindelin <<BR>>

Miklos and Dscho will be porting the git-merge shell script
to C, permitting it to make use of builtin functions like
merge base computation, and making the program overall more
portable to non-POSIX systems.  Porting some of the popular
merge strategies (e.g. git-merge-ours) will also be done as
time permits.

== git-sequencer ==
<b>Student:</b> Stephan Beyer                     <<BR>>
<b>Mentor:</b>  Christian Couder, Daniel Barkalow <<BR>>

Stephan, Christian and Daniel will be working to port the
current "git rebase --interactive" to C, as well as create
a general "commit sequencer" that can be used as the backing
implementation for "git-am", all three forms of "git-rebase",
and possibly implement an "interactive rebase GUI" within
git-gui and/or gitk.
