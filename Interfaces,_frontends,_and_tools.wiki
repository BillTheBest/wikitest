= Frontends and Interfaces =

== Version Control Interface layers ==

=== Core Git (in distribution) ===
* Core Git contains a set of scripts on top of the [[Git]] plumbing providing a version control system interface distributed along the Git itself. It also bundles stable versions of [[#git-gui|git-gui]] and [[#gitk|gitk]].

=== Cogito (deprecated) ===
* [[Cogito]] for some time was the most popular version control system on top of Git. It aims at seamless user interface and ease of use, providing generally smoother user experience than the "raw" Git interface and indeed also many other version control systems. Note that Cogito is ''no longer maintained or recommended''. Git 1.5.0 and beyond has incorporated many features that make it suitable for direct use without needing additional software.

=== IsiSetup ===
* [http://www.isisetup.ch/ IsiSetup] (APT for your config) is a utility to help managing your configuration files with Git as backend. You can rollback changes, explore the history of changes, replicate your configuration, backup your configuration and blame changes to admins.<BR> ''See also:'' [http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/etckeeper/ etckeeper].

=== Easy Git ===
* [http://www.gnome.org/~newren/eg/ Easy Git (eg)] Easy Git is a wrapper for Git that is designed to make git easy to learn and use. Easy Git aims to be easily learnable, interchangeable with Git, fully capable, and compatible with Git. Users can move back and forth between using Easy Git and Git itself.

=== Yap ===
* [http://repo.or.cz/w/yap.git yap (Yet Another Git Porcelain)] Yap is an alternative porcelain for git that is designed to have a friendlier, more orthogonal interface. It is also easily extensible with python plugins.

=== darcs-git ===
* [http://git.frugalware.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=pacman-tools.git;a=blob;f=darcs-git.py;hb=HEAD darcs-git.py] (and its [http://git.frugalware.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=pacman-tools.git;a=blob;f=darcs-git.txt;hb=HEAD documentation]) darcs-git is a darcs-like porcelain on top of git plumbing. If you are accustomed to darcs, this porcelain will let you use git via the familiar darcs user interface.

=== repo ===
* [http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=tools/repo.git repo] is a project to use Git to build OS distributions; similar to Git submodules, it can track specified branches from Git projects.<BR>''See also:'' [http://newblogtopic.blogspot.com/2008/11/gerrit-and-repo-android-source_04.html Gerrit and Repo, the Android Source Management Tools] blog post by Jeff Bailey

=== vng ===
* [http://repo.or.cz/w/vng.git vng] is a Darcs-like Git porcelain by Thomas Zander. It was first [http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2008/03/30/sourcecode-collaboration/ announced here].

=== Zit ===
* [http://git.oblomov.eu/zit Zit] by Giuseppe Bilotta is the Git-based single file content tracker; it uses Git to independently track single files within a directory; sort of like what RCS does, but with the power, flexibility, elegance and ease of use of Git. Still in alpha stage.<BR> You can get it from `git://git.oblomov.eu/zit`

== Interfaces to other programming languages ==

=== Git::CPAN::Patch ===

* [http://search.cpan.org/~yanick/Git-CPAN-Patch Git::CPAN::Patch] provides a suite of git commands aimed at making trivially easy the process of grabbing any distribution off CPAN, stuffing it in a local git repository and, once gleeful hacking has been perpetrated, sending back patches to its maintainer.

=== GitPython ===
* A Python module that provides read-only object model access to your Git repositories by calling the Git executables and parsing output. Once you have created a repository object, you can traverse it to find parent commit(s), trees, blobs, etc.. Port of the [http://grit.rubyforge.org/ grit] library in Ruby created by Tom Preston-Werner and Chris Wanstrath. Git repository is [http://gitorious.org/projects/git-python/ available here].

=== Dulwich ===
* [http://samba.org/~jelmer/dulwich/ Dulwich] is a pure-Python read-write implementation of the Git file formats and protocols. It is named after the village in which Mr. and Mrs. Git live in the Monty Python sketch. A Git repository ca be found at git://git.samba.org/jelmer/dulwich.git and its gitweb [http://git.samba.org/?p=jelmer/dulwich.git;a=summary here].

=== PyGit (abandoned?) ===
* Pythonic [http://code.istique.net/?p=pygit.git git bindings] targeted towards porcelains. There is also the [http://code.istique.net/?p=pygit.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/stores "stores" branch] that implements pack and object reading natively in Python.

=== Grit ===
* [http://grit.rubyforge.org/ Grit] is a Ruby library for extracting information from a git repository in an object oriented manner. This includes a [http://github.com/blog/107-supercharged-ruby-git partial native Ruby implementation], which is used for a number of the operations.

=== git_store ===
* [http://github.com/georgi/git_store GitStore] implements a versioned data store based on the revision management system Git. You can store object hierarchies as nested hashes, which will be mapped on the directory structure of a git repository. Basically GitStore checks out the repository into a in-memory representation, which can be modified and finally committed. GitStore reads and writes the git repository natively in Ruby.

=== gitrb ===
* [http://github.com/minad/gitrb GitRb] is another partial native implementation of Git in Ruby similar to grit.

=== v ===
* [http://github.com/boof/v v] is another Ruby library providing a git adapter that makes working with git repositories easy. Git operations are mapped almost 1:1 to ruby methods and executed in a seperate thread returning futures when they're queued. It supports core git objects and convenience objects (indexes, branches, ...) which will provide a convenient API. It is still under development, means except for few examples there is no real documentation and most of the git operations still need to be implemented (first [[CommandLine]] wrapper (porcelain and plumbing), then pure Ruby (plumbing and then porcelain)).

=== Ruby/Git (deprecated) ===
* [http://jointheconversation.org/rubygit/ Ruby/Git] ([http://github.com/schacon/git-ruby github]) is a Ruby library that can be used to create, read and manipulate Git repositories. Unmaintained, abandoned in favor of mentioned above [http://grit.rubyforge.org/ Grit].

=== Objective Git ===
* [http://github.com/schacon/objective-git ObjectiveGit] is an Objective-C partial implementation of Git and a corresponding object level library that can be used to create, read and manipulate Git repositories. It also contains git server implementations (receive-pack and upload-pack).

=== JGit (Java) ===
* See below in Editors and IDE integration

=== JavaGit ===
* [http://javagit.sourceforge.net JavaGit] is an API providing access to git repositories for Java applications. JavaGit is engineered to provide the developer with access to the raw git commands through a command API as well as an object API designed to represent the .git repository, the working tree and other, familiar git concepts. JavaGit uses the git binaries installed on the host machine to provide git functionality and has been designed to easily accommodate additional methods of access to git repositories. JavaGit is released as open source software under the GNU LGPL license.<BR>''Currently in early alpha version'' <BR>''See also:'' [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/91381 NYU Open Source Programming Class Releases JavaGit API 0.1.0 Alpha] thread on git mailing list.

=== glip ===
* [http://fimml.at/glip glip], the ''git library in PHP'', provides read and write access to Git repositories without using exec() or system() calls. Therefore it works on many shared web hosting accounts.

=== dotGit ===
* [http://github.com/pheew/dotgit/tree/master dotGit] is an experimental implementation for .NET written in C#. It is still in it's early stages but can read objects from packed and loose storage. So all the read-only operations are supported. A diff engine is in the works.

=== Git# (GitSharp) ===
* [http://www.eqqon.com/index.php/GitSharp Git#] for .NET is written in C#. Being a straight port of JGit, Git# is the most advanced and fastest moving of all emerging implementations on Windows. It is aimed to be fully compatible to the original Git and can be either used as stand alone command line application (potentially replacing msysGit) or as library for windows applications such as gui frontends or plugins for IDEs.

== Patch-management Interface layers ==

=== StGIT (Stacked Git) ===
* StGIT ([http://www.procode.org/stgit/ homepage]) provides a Quilt-like patch management functionality (i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) in the Git environment. You can easily manage your patches in the scope of Git until they get merged upstream.<BR> ''See also'': [http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/ Quilt project page].

=== Guilt (formerly Git Queues (gq)) ===
* [[Guilt|guilt]] ([http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jsipek/guilt/ download], [http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/jsipek/guilt.git;a=summary gitweb]) by Josef "Jeff" Sipek is a series of bash scripts which add a [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MqExtension Mercurial queues]-like functionality and interface to git. The one distinguishing feature from other Quilt-like porcelains, is the format of the patches directory. All the information is stored as plain text - a series file and the patches (one per file). This easily lends itself to versioning the patches using any number of of SCMs.

=== TopGit ===
* TopGit ([http://repo.or.cz/w/topgit.git gitweb], [http://repo.or.cz/w/topgit.git?a=blob;f=README README]) by Petr 'Pasky' Baudis is patch management interface done as a shell script, which can be used to manage queue of third-party patches on top of another project. It is a very thin layer on top of Git (allowing to use index), it attempts to keep all history of your changes till final cleanup, and allows to specify patch dependencies instead of linearizing patches in patch series (patch queue).<BR> ''In early stages of development.''<BR> ''See also:'' [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/91197 TopGit - A different patch queue manager] announcement on git mailing list.

=== Patchy Git (pg), deprecated ===
* [[Pg|pg]] ([http://www.spearce.org/category/projects/scm/pg/ homepage]) by Shawn Pearce aims to help the user manage a set of patches on top of the current branch. pg is somewhat like Quilt or StGIT, but it does have a slightly different feature set. ''Note that pg is no longer being actively developed.''

{{anchor|gui}}
== Graphical Interfaces ==

=== gitk (distributed with Git) ===
* [[Gitk|gitk]] is a simple Tcl/Tk GUI for browsing history of Git repositories easily, distributed with Git.

It was inspired by and initially based on [[#gitool|gitool]]. Written in Tcl/Tk. Stable versions are shipped with Core Git since version 1.5.

=== tig (Text-mode Interface for Git) ===
* [[Tig|tig]] ([http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/ homepage]) by Jonas Fonseca is a simple git repository browser written using ncurses. Basically, it just acts as a front-end for `git-log` and `git-show`/`git-diff`. Additionally, you can also use it as a pager for git commands.

=== QGit ===
* QGit ([http://digilander.libero.it/mcostalba/ homepage]) is a Qt GUI for browsing the history of Git repositories. It also acts as a commit tool, like [[#hgct|(h)gct]] and as a graphical interface to [[#StGIT|StGIT]]. There is an experimental version of QGit ported under Qt4.2 libraries, available at http://repo.or.cz/w/qgit4.git. This means that it could be compiled and run as a Windows native application. As of November '09, no developper activity for nearly 6 months.

=== Giggle ===
* Giggle ([http://live.gnome.org/giggle homepage]) is a graphical frontend for browsing history of Git repositories (think of gitk on GTK+). Result of a Hackathon 2007, later developed by Imendio's Carlos Garnacho and Sven Herzberg. Currently maintained by Mathias Hasselmann. Available from http://github.com/hasselmm/giggle/.

=== gitview (in `contrib/`) ===
* [[GitView]] is a GTK based repository browser for git written in Python by Aneesh Kumar K.V. It can be found in `contrib/` directory of Git source tree.

=== git-forest ===
* ''git-forest'' ([http://dev.medozas.de/gitweb.cgi?p=hxtools;a=blob_plain;f=bin/git-forest git-forest] file and [http://dev.medozas.de/gitweb.cgi?p=hxtools;a=blob_plain;f=doc/git-forest.1 manpage]) is a text-based tree visualizer, using Unicode characters for tree graphics. Part of its key features are: display of tags, heads and other refs (like gitk), constantly vertical branch graphics (allows to follow a branch with the mouse easily), display of octopus merges. It can also display history in reverse.

A screenshot may be found at [http://jengelh.medozas.de/images/git-forest.png git-forest.png]. Written in Perl by Jan Engelhardt.<BR>''See also:'' [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/76404 text-based tree visualizer] announcement on git mailing list.

=== Deprecated and stalled projects ===

==== (h)gct (deprecated) ====
* [[(h)gct]] ([http://repo.or.cz/w/hgct.git gitweb]) by Fredrik Kuivinen is a GUI enabled commit tool. It has support for both Git and Mercurial. In Debian in [http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=names&keywords=commit-tool commit-tool] package. Written in PyQt. Does not support git 1.6 and higher.

==== gitool (deprecated) ====
* [[Gitool|gitool]] ([http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/26415 announcement], [http://ozlabs.org/~paulus/gitool download], [http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=gitk/gitk.git;a=shortlog;h=new gitweb]) by Paul Mackerras is a tool for creating commits. Superseded by git-gui (see above). Last development activity in 2007. Written in Tcl/Tk.

==== GitNub (stalled) ====
* GitNub ([http://github.com/Caged/gitnub/wikis homepage], [http://github.com/Caged/gitnub/tree/master github]) by Justin Palmer is an Mac OSX Leopard client for git written in Ruby and Objective-C.
<!-- ## is it more like gitk or qgit, or more like git-gui?
 -->

==== KGit (deprecated) ====
* [[KGit]] (http://kgit.sourceforge.net/) by Abhijit Bhopatkar is intended to be a small but functional frontend to the popular source control program, git. It is similar to gitk with two significant differences. First of all, it is written in Qt using lop and the KDE libraires. Secondly, it is not only a repository viewer, unlike gitk. It is now defunct and deprecated by the author. Has no future.

==== Push Me Pull You (stalled) ====
* [http://pmpu.sharesource.org/ pmpu] (Push Me Pull You) by Mark Williamson is a graphical interface for a distributed version control system. Currently it contains proof-of-concept supports the Mercurial, git and bzr systems. PMPU can make use of external history views and commit tools. Preview release. As of November '09, no developper activity for more than 1 year.

{{anchor|web-interface}}
== Web Interface ==

=== gitweb (distributed with Git) ===
* [[Gitweb|gitweb]] provides full-fledged web interface for Git repositories. It is written in Perl and was maintained by Kay Sievers; from git version 1.4.0 it is distributed with Git. Used at [http://www.kernel.org/git/ kernel.org] and [http://repo.or.cz repo.or.cz]. The [http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/index.php/Main_Page XMMS2 project] maintains their own version of gitweb which has some additional features. The latest snapshot of this effort can be downloaded from http://git.xmms.se/?p=gitweb-xmms2.git;a=summary. John 'Warthog9' has added in caching to the gitweb, and split it into many modules. See it at work at http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=git/warthog9/gitweb.git;a=summary. Changes are published at `git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/warthog9/gitweb.git`. See also: [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/35692 Gitweb - caching] message at git mailing list.

=== Gitorious ===
* [http://gitorious.org/ Gitorious ] provides free open source infrastructure for open source projects that use Git. Open Source and Ruby on Rails based. 

=== InDefero ===
* [http://www.indefero.net InDefero] is a clone of GoogleCode with git, Mercurial and Subversion browser, wiki, download area, issue tracking and code review supporting multiple private/public projects. Using a shared user account with SSH keys you can control the read/write access rights to your repositories from within the web interface. GNU GPL/Clean MVC PHP5 code, very fast and easy to extend. [http://projects.ceondo.com/p/indefero/downloads/ Download], [http://projects.ceondo.com/p/indefero/source/tree/master/ view source]. Free hosting also available.

=== Wit ===
* [[Wit]] (http://dan.chokola.com/software/wit.rhtml) is a Ruby/eRuby web interface to git that provides much easier setup, configuration, maintainability, and customizability than gitweb, all in fewer lines of code and with a prettier interface. It is maintained by [http://dan.chokola.com/ Daniel Chokola] of the XMMS2 project. See it in action [http://dan.chokola.com/wit here]. The website does not seem to be working. Anyone able to find Wit online?

=== wit (defunct?) ===
* ''wit'' ([http://www.absolutegiganten.org/wit/ download]) is a Python implementation maintained by Christian Meder. Uses PATH_INFO URLs extensively. See it in work [http://www.grmso.net:8090/ here].

=== gitarella ===
* [http://flameeyes.is-a-geek.org/projects#gitarella gitarella] ([http://freshmeat.net/projects/gitarella/ freshmeat project page]) is a Ruby-based Git web frontend, created and maintained by Flameeyes. It is inspired by and following the style of gitweb. It supports CGI and FastCGI interfaces. See it in work on [http://git.flameeyes.is-a-geek.org/gitarella/ gitarella repository].

=== ginatra ===
* ''ginatra'' ([http://github.com/lenary/ginatra/ github], [http://ginatra.lenary.co.uk/ demo]) is web interface written in Ruby using [http://www.sinatrarb.com Sinatra] web framework.

=== git-php ===
* [http://code.google.com/p/git-php/ git-php] is a PHP git web frontend created by Zack Bartel. The goal of git-php is a robust PHP web interface to git repositories. It is meant to be easily customizable through styles and the ability to be embedded into any PHP page. For example, creating a git repository viewer plug-in for your favorite PHP based CMS should be easy with git-php. It seems to be inspired by gitweb. See it at work at [http://zackb.org/git-php/git.php zackb.org].
* http://people.proekspert.ee/peeter/git/git.php is a PHP git web frontend created by Peeter Vois. This is continued work of Zack's version of git.php. git-php does now have syntax highlighting of code, graph view of the repository including branch and tag, diff can be browsed against several parent versions, tree browser does have some nice icons, simple search for branch heads and tags, any version of tree can be downloaded in tar.gz or zip format and the filename will include hash of the tree or tag if attached, files can be downloaded independently in binary form. Git php is providing interface for sending bundles to the owner of the site. This is useful for those who would like to stay anonymous or do not like to send bundles via e-mail. The bundle is also tested against the repository before acceptance.
* http://github.com/josegonzalez/git-php is a PHP git web frontend created by Jose Diaz-Gonzalez. Contains updates to Peeter Vois and Zack Bartel's work that adds a github-like stylesheet, as well as fixes for the latest updates to git syntax. It is also an attempt to ameliorate the differences between gitweb and all other gitweb derivatives with git-php.

=== GitPHP ===
* [http://www.xiphux.com/programming/php/gitphp/ GitPHP] ([http://gitphp.xiphux.com/ demo]) is a PHP git web interface with gitweb-like look (the xmms2 fork of git), created by Christopher Han. It makes use of [http://smarty.php.net/ Smarty] templates, so it can be easily modified and customized. It offers syntax highlighting via [http://qbnz.com/highlighter/ GeSHi] PHP class, has support for snapshots and projects categories; it can be run with msysGit.

=== viewgit ===
* [http://viewgit.sourceforge.net/ viewgit] is another PHP web interface for git, written from scratch. It aims to be easy to set up and upgrade, light on dependencies, and comfortable to use. It provides all basic features such as commitdiffs, RSS feeds of changes, downloading of trees, checkouts, syntax highlighting using GeSHi, etc.

=== cgit ===
* [http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/ cgit] is a fast and lightweight webinterface written in C. It uses libgit.a to avoid forking of git commands and an on-disk cache to avoid duplication of expensive repository operations. The repo is hosted on [http://hjemli.net/git/ hjemli.net] and can be cloned from git://hjemli.net/pub/git/cgit. Users of cgit include [http://cgit.freedesktop.org freedesktop.org], [http://cgit.compiz-fusion.org/ compiz-fusion.org], [http://git.dyne.org dyne.org], [http://repo.or.cz/c/ repo.or.cz], [http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/ savannah.gnu.org] and [http://git.gnome.org/cgit/ gnome.org].

=== Gitalist ===
* [http://p3rl.org/Gitalist Gitalist] ([http://git.shadowcat.co.uk/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=catagits/Gitalist.git;a=summary gitweb], [http://github.com/broquaint/Gitalist github], [http://goatse.co.uk/~bobtfish/Gitalist/script/gitalist.fcgi/ demo]) is a web frontend for git repositories written in Perl and backed by [http://www.catalystframework.org/ Catalyst] web framework.  It used gitweb.cgi as template, and attempts to be URI compatibile with gitweb.<BR> ''See also:'' [http://conferences.yapceurope.org/lpw2009/talk/2446 Zac Stevens' talk at London Perl Workshop 2009].

=== GitStat ===
* ''GitStat'' ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitstat SourceForge project]) is a GPL'd, web-based git statistics/monitoring system. It retrieves a specified git tree, analyzes changesets, and shows graphical information like the number of changesets per day, the number of people who submitted changesets for a specific version (tag) etc. Users may subscribe to gitstat so that they automatically receive an email notification if any change is applied to a specified directory. See also [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/56161 gitstat 0.1: kernel development statistics / monitoring system] announcement on git mailing list. You are welcome to try gitstat at http://tree.celinuxforum.org/gitstat

=== [[GitStats]] ===
* ''[[GitStats]]'' - with a 's', not the same as ![[GitStat]] - ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitstats/ SourceForge project]) is a statistics generator for git repositories. It examines the repository and produces some interesting statistics from the history. Currently it outputs only HTML. As opposed to ![[GitStat]], it generates the HTML statically, and is therefore suitable to generate pages to upload to a dumb HTTP server. Some [http://gitstats.sourceforge.net/examples/ examples] are available.

=== git-browser ===
* [http://straytree.com/ git-browser] by Arteem Khodush is an experimental gitk-like web interface. It visualizes commit history graph and shows commit diffs. User interface is done in JavaScript, and is rather heavy on the ''client'' side. [http://straytree.com/git-browser/by-commit.html?r=git view online] [http://straytree.com/git-browser.tar.bz2 download] [http://repo.or.cz/gitweb.cgi/git-browser.git gitweb mirror].

= Tools =

== Editors and IDE integration ==

=== Emacs integration (in `contrib/`) ===
* Preliminary Emacs mode for Git from Alexandre Julliard (in `contrib/emacs` directory) consist of `git.el` which is project tree browser similar to pcl-cvs, and `vc-git.el` which is VC backend (see also vc-git-hacking at [http://www.gnuvola.org/wip/ gnuvola]).<BR> There is also a project, [http://download.gna.org/dvc/ DVC] (Distributed Version Control), on Gna!, by the authors of Xtla, to create a generic library for fancy Emacs interfaces to modern version control systems. Currently it supports [http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/ GNU Arch] (''tla'') and [http://freshmeat.net/projects/baz/ Bazaar] (''baz''), and has initial support for [http://bazaar-vcs.org/ Bazaar-NG] (''bzr'') and [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/ Mercurial] (''xhg'').
* ''See also:'' [[EmacsWiki]]:Git and [[EmacsWiki]]:[[Category:VersionControl]] pages on [http://www.emacswiki.org EmacsWiki]

=== Java GIT/Eclipse GIT ===
* [http://repo.or.cz/w/egit.git Java GIT/Eclipse GIT] (repository) originated by Shawn Pearce is a Java GIT library and plugin for [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] IDE, in very early stages of development. The site no longer seems to have the plugin. Robin Rosenberg has recently been working on history and compare views for the plugin. David Watson contributed GUI for branch handling and commit. Progress is slow but steady. A [[EclipsePluginWishlist]] has been started as a roadmap of features. A page has been started to follow development: [[EclipsePlugin]].

=== Git4Idea ===
* The Git4Idea plugin provides basic Git integration support for the IntelliJ/[[JetBrains]] IDEA (v6 & above) development environment. The Git4Idea plugin can be downloaded from within IDEA itself using the IDE Settings->Plugins config panel. The [http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin?id=3033 plugin home page] contains the latest release information and source code is also available [http://github.com/markscott/git4idea/tree/master here]. Git4Idea uses the git command line tool to work; Cygwin 'git' on Windows is recommended.

=== KDevelop ===
* Development of a Git plugin for kdevelop has begun. [http://drwxr-xr-x.blogspot.com/2008/06/now-kdevelop-has-basic-git-support.html Basic support implemented]

=== Netbeans module (nbgit) ===
* A [[NetBeansPlugin]] with a limited set of features are available for testing.

=== Padre ===
* [http://search.cpan.org/~KAARE/Padre-Plugin-Git/ Padre-Plugin-Git] provides basic Git integration for Padre, a text editor being developed as an IDE for Perl.

=== PIDA ===
* [http://pida.co.uk/ PIDA] Integrated development environment supporting GIT, Subversion, Darcs, Mercurial, Monotone, Bazaar-NG (''bzr''). It allows embedding Vim or emacs. ''(Python, GTK)''

=== [[TextMate]] ===
* [http://github.com/timcharper/git-tmbundle/ Git-tmBundle] Provides a variety of tools for interacting with Git repositories, such as push, pull, tag, fetch, browse annotations, merge, switching branches, stashing, committing, etc. ''(Ruby)''

=== Vim ===
* [http://code.google.com/p/vcscommand/ VCS Command plugin] is a Vim plugin for various source code control systems and includes a Git component. It can be used to view the differences side by side, commit, blame, etc.
* Other Vim [http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Using_Git_from_Vim tips]

=== Visual Studio ===

* [http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/ Git Extensions]. See Graphical Interfaces above or website for details.

== Merge tools ==

=== Diffuse ===
* [http://diffuse.sourceforge.net Diffuse] is a graphical tool for merging and comparing text files. Diffuse is able to compare an arbitrary number of files side-by-side and gives users the ability to manually adjust line-matching and directly edit files. Diffuse can also retrieve revisions of files from Bazaar, CVS, Darcs, Git, Mercurial, Monotone, Subversion, and SVK repositories for comparison and merging.

=== dirdiff ===
* [http://www.liacs.nl/~sverdool/gitweb.cgi?p=dirdiff.git dirdiff] (gitweb) is a graphical tool to display the differences (a la diff) between files in directories. Given two or more directory trees, dirdiff will display the differences between them in various glorious colors. It provides merging and the creation of patches. Link is to version modified by Sven Verdoolaege, which adds some more git support, and which is based on [http://samba.org/ftp/paulus/dirdiff-2.1.tar.gz dirdiff-2.1.tar.gz] by Paul Mackerras. Not actively developed. In Tcl/Tk. (To be not conffused with [http://sourceforge.net/projects/dirdiff/ dirdiff] in Perl).

=== Meld ===
* [http://meld.sourceforge.net Meld] is a visual diff and merge tool. You can compare two or three files and edit them in place (diffs update dynamically). You can compare two or three folders and launch file comparisons. You can browse and view a working copy from popular version control systems such as Git, CVS, Subversion, Bazaar-ng and Mercurial, etc...

{{anchor|rcs-interaction}}
== Interaction with other Revision Control Systems ==

=== Multiple Systems ===

==== Built-in import (built in) ====
* Core Git contains import commands for importing from other systems: `git-archimport` for [http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/ GNU Arch] (`tla`), `git-cvsimport` for [http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/ CVS] (needs `cvsps`: [http://ydirson.free.fr/en/software/scm/cvsps.html CVSps patches]), `git-svn` for [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] (`svn`) (using `SVN::Perl` module), `git-quiltimport` for [https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/ Quilt], and `git-p4import` for [http://www.perforce.com/ Perforce] (`p4`). For Quilt see also quilt2git / git2guilt below. For Perforce import there is also a script using alternative import method, which works without changing local state: [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/25352 git-p4-import]. There also exists a (dumb and slow) unpublished BitKeeper (`bk`) importer.

==== Tailor ====
* [http://wiki.darcs.net/DarcsWiki/Tailor Tailor] is an any-to-any version control system converter, with support for most free SCMs. It was written by Lele and it is implemented in Python. Note that you need [http://wiki.darcs.net/DarcsWiki/Tailor/VersionOne [[VersionOne]]]. Note also that as of 2006-12-01, it only has rudimentary support for branches, and mostly supports linear histories.

=== CVS ===
==== git-cvsexportcommit (built in) ====
* `git-cvsexportcommit` exports a commit from Git to a CVS checkout, making it easier to merge patches from a git repository into a CVS repository. Supports file additions, removals, and commits that affect binary files.

==== git-cvsserver (built in) ====
* `git-cvsserver` is a CVS emulation layer for git. It is highly functional; the mapping is bidirectional, so people who like cvs, can do both checkout and commit using cvs, and it shows up in git. However, not all methods are implemented, and for those methods that are implemented, not all switches are implemented. Testing has been done using both the CLI CVS client, and the Eclipse CVS plugin. Most functionality works fine with both of these clients.

==== parsecvs ====
* [http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~keithp/parsecvs/ parsecvs] by Keith Packard is a C-based CVS file parser and Git import tool. It directly reads RCS ,v files (you can get them using CVSsuck if you don't have access to $CVSROOT) and generates a git-style rev-list structure from them. Repository available at git://anongit.freedesktop.org/~keithp/parsecvs

==== cvs2git ====
* [http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/ cvs2svn] has a [http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/cvs2git.html cvs2git] mode for converting directly from CVS to git. cvs2svn/cvs2git is very robust and gives high-quality conversions with many [http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/features.html features and customization options]. cvs2svn/cvs2git only supports one-time conversions. cvs2git's output can be read by Shawn Pearce's [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-fast-import.html git-fast-import], which has been bundled with core Git since version 1.5.<BR> Note that cvs2svn/cvs2git itself can't work with remote repositories. If you can't get a copy of the CVS repository directly, you might be able to recreate it indirectly via [http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/faq.html#repoaccess information read over the CVS protocol] using a tool like [http://cvs.m17n.org/~akr/cvssuck/ CVSsuck].

==== fromcvs/togit ====
* [http://ww2.fs.ei.tum.de/~corecode/hg/fromcvs fromcvs] by Simon 'corecode' Schubert is a conversion tool ment convert from CVS to multiple SCMs. At the moment there is a git and a hg output and a sqlite output for quick CVS changeset navigation. For the cvs->git conversion, git-fast-import by Shawn Pearce is needed (see above). fromcvs handles branches (though no tags yet), including native support for vendor branches. Incremental operation should work, but was not yet tested extensively. Conversion speed should be well above 10 changesets per second on common hardware. fromcvs/togit can take advantage of two CPUs.

==== gc-utils ====
* [http://gcutils.sourceforge.net/ gc-utils] ([http://freshmeat.net/projects/gc-utils/ freshmeat page], [http://git.experimentalworks.net/?p=gcutils.git gitweb], [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/78540 announcement]) is a small set of scripts wrapping git-cvsexportcommit and git-cvsimport, allowing to import and update CVS repositories into git very easy and let you export patches back into a CVS working copy. Written in bash.

=== Subversion ===

==== git-svn (built in) ====
* [http://git-svn.yhbt.net/ git-svn] ([http://git.bogomips.org/git-svn.git git repository]), written by Eric Wong, is a conduit for bidirectional operation between a Subversion repository and git. It supports Subversion branches and tags, importing multiple Subversion repositories into a single git repository, and incrementally updating the git repository with changes from the Subversion parent. It is designed for developers who wish to contribute to projects that use Subversion, but would rather be using git. Written in Perl using the SVN::Core Perl library.<BR> ''See also:'' [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/102500||ANNOUNCE  git-svn-bugfix script]

==== git-svnimport (contrib) ====
* There is also git-svnimport, and because it came earlier it is mentioned often in old documentation. At the moment (August, 2008), git-svn is better supported.

==== git2svn (perl/bash) ====
* [http://voltar.org/git2svn/ git2svn], written by Paul Miller, is a git repo exporter designed to allow a user to import numerous git repos into a [http://trac.edgewall.org/ trac] wiki. Trac only supports svn (natively) and only supports a one repo configuration. Although there are git plugins for Trac, they are cumbersome and (because of trac's design) only support one repo at a time. git2svn solves that by importing as many git repos as needed into directories of an svn repo. It does this using native svn and git commands with perl as glue.

==== git2svn (fast-export) ====
* git2svn ([http://repo.or.cz/w/git2svn.git gitweb]), written by Love Hrnquist strand, is a tool to convert the "git fast-export" dump into a svn dump and load it into a new fresh svn repository. git2svn also supports incremental updates. ''NOTE:'' ''git2svn assumes its the only process that writes into the svn repository''. Written mainly in Perl.<BR> ''See:'' [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/79680||ANNOUNCE  git2svn 0.1] post on git mailing list.

==== git2svn.pl (yet another one) ====
* git2svn.pl ([http://repo.or.cz/w/nagiosplugins.git?a=blob;f=tools/git2svn.pl gitweb]), by Thomas Guyot-Sionnest, has been written to keep Nagios-plugins SVN tree updated from Git. It uses "git svn set-tree" to update the old subversion repository. Forced updated are possible (with manual intervention) as set-tree just apply a given snapshot with the last commit message. Under normal operation all commits are applied (not just the latest) and a "From:" line is inserted in the message to keep tracks of who commited what from SVN commit logs.

==== svn2git.py ====
* svn2git.py ([http://python.ca/nas/python/svn2git.py download]), written by Neil Schemenauer, is a tool to do conversions from SVN (Subversion) to git using a SVN dump. It's in early stages of development. Written in Python.<BR> ''See:'' [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/101370 New converstion tool: svn2git.py] thread on git mailing list

==== svn2git (Ruby) ====
* svn2git ([http://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git/ github]), forked by Kevin Menard from James Coglan project, is a Ruby tool for importing existing svn projects into git and github. It uses git-svn.

{{anchor|git-svnconvert}}
==== git-svnconvert ====
* git-svnconvert, written by Rutger Nijlunsing in Ruby, appeared only on git mailing list in post [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=git&m=114460050718696||ANNOUNCE  git-svnconvert: YASI (Yet Another SVN importer)].

==== svn-all-fast-export ====
* svn-all-fast-export ([http://repo.or.cz/w/svn-all-fast-export.git gitweb]) by Thiago Macieira, is a tool that exports from Subversion onto multiple Git repositories via git-fast-import. Written in C++, uses Qt Core library.

==== braid ====
* [http://evil.che.lu/projects/braid Braid] ([http://github.com/evilchelu/braid/tree/master github]), formerly [http://evil.che.lu/2007/11/27/ann-giston-piston-lookalike-for-git Giston], is a [http://piston.rubyforge.org/index.html Piston] lookalike for git-svn: a simple tool to help track svn vendor branches in your git repository. By Cristi Balan, in Ruby (Piston is in Ruby).

==== git-rails-plugins ====
* GIT sub-project porcelain that provides an alternative to git-svn dcommit when managing rails vendor plugins which are held in a central SVN repository. Currently git-svn is not able to dcommit into a Subversion repository when a Git repository contains submodules. [http://github.com/nazar/git-rails-plugins/tree/master git-rails-plugins] is an [http://panthersoftware.com/articles/view/4/git-svn-dcommit-workaround-for-git-submodules alternative] implementation to sub-modules.

=== Mercurial ===

==== hg-to-git ====
* hg-to-git is Mercurial to git converter, written by Stelian Pop, appeared only on git mailing list in post [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/36601 Mercurial to git converter.] It supports incremental conversion, supports (multiple) hg branches and converts hg tags. Written in combination of shell script and Python.<BR>

==== hg-fast-export ====
* hg-fast-export is another converter using `git-fast-import` as backend and is written in Python using the mecurial python classes directly. It uses a single pass, supports tags, mercurial named branches, incremental imports and merges. It is quite fast since no subshells and/or pipe communication is used except for the feed to `git-fast-import`. The source is available as part of the fast-export repository at [http://repo.or.cz/w/fast-export.git repo.or.cz].
=== Darcs ===

==== darcs-to-git ====
* Having had problems with darcs2git and tailor, [http://www.sanityinc.com/ Steve Purcell] wrote another simple darcs import tool called darcs-to-git, which can incrementally import a single darcs source repo: [http://www.sanityinc.com/articles/converting-darcs-repositories-to-git article] / [http://git.sanityinc.com/?p=darcs-to-git.git darcs-to-git gitweb]

==== Darcs-Git ====
* [http://darcs.net/DarcsWiki/DarcsGit Darcs-Git] was an effort to make Darcs work with Git repositories, in particular the Linux kernel repository. It was part Darcs-Unstable branch, available from http://abridgegame.org/repos/darcs-unstable . Unfortunately, both links are now defunct.

==== darcs-fast-export ====
* A generic fast-export script for darcs by Miklos Vajna, works with git fast-import, bzr fast-import and hg fastimport. Find it at [http://vmiklos.hu/project/darcs-fast-export here].

==== darcs2git ====

E.g. user sends report "linux-2.6.16 with configuration XYZZY fails to compile with: <code><nowiki>arch/wii/kernel/l33t.c:42:parse error</nowiki></code>" and with the remap tool you can map the error report to the current commit's state, when that bit of code got moved around to `drivers/input/wii/l33tcontrol.c:31337`. It also already very useful for log comparison, with the noise due to line number changes excluded. Note that it's not just for build logs; the thing is useful for sparse logs, grep -n output, etc., etc. <BR> ''See also:'' [http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2006/110706-kernel-warnings.html Kernel space: Buried in warnings] article at [http://www.linuxworld.com/ LinuxWorld.com].

It handles details such as setting the version number and release date, tagging the release in GIT, exporting, running any unit-tests, uploading the archive, pushing the tag, and updating your Zero Install feed. The workflow is: run the script (creates a tarball), do any manual release testing, then either publish everything or fail the release (reverting to your repository's previous state ready to make changes and try again). Only two user interactions are required: starting the script and confirming the generated release.

=== ./release.sh ===
* [http://osndok.com/git-release/ ./release.sh] is a simple mechanism to create and tag release branches on a remote (centralized/blessed) git repository. Alpha-quality. Does not have any "server-side" hooks to actually do something with the releases or method to simplify tracking new release branches. (Do not confuse this with the "build recipes" in [[msysGit]].)

=== git-age ===
* [http://wiki.github.com/krig/git-age git-age] is a `git blame` visualizer, written using PyGTK. Shows the file with information on author, commit etc on each line. Also colors the background of the line darker for older commits and lighter for newer commits. Useful for quickly seeing what parts of a file have changed recently. Will also attempt to retrieve Gravatars for all authors in the file asynchronously.

=== Flashbake ===
* [http://bitbucketlabs.net/flashbake/ Flashbake] is something between continuous, automated backup system and version control for writers. It is written in Python and uses Git for storage. <BR>''See also:'' [http://www.boingboing.net/2009/02/13/flashbake-free-versi.html Flashbake: Free version-control for writers using git] by Cory Doctorow on BoingBoing.

=== git_fast_filter and git-rewrite-commits ===
* ''git_fast_filter'' ([http://gitorious.org/projects/git_fast_filter gitorious]) by Elijah Newren assists with quickly rewriting the history of a repository by making it easy to write scripts whose purpose is to serve as safe filters between [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-fast-export.html fast-export] and [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-fast-import.html fast-import]. git_fast_filter comes with example programs,and a basic test-suite. <BR>''See'' [http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/116028 announcement on git mailing list] and the following thread.
* ''git-rewrite-commits'' by Sven Verdoolaege is an alternate interface to [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-filter-branch.html git-filter-branch]-like functionality (more similar to cg-admin-rewritehist from Cogito). It is available from git mailing list archives fro [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/52323| PATCH 0/6| Add git-rewrite-commits v2] thread.

=== git-subtree ===
* ''git-subtree'' ([http://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree github]) by Avery Pennarun is an experimental alternative to the git-submodule command, making it easier to use workflow which uses "subtree" merge strategy. The series introducing git-submodule was posted twice on git mailing list: [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/117612 here] and [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/118635 here].<BR>''See also:'' [http://alumnit.ca/~apenwarr/log/?m=200904#30 A new alternative to git submodules: git subtree] blog post (and [http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=604889 comments]).

=== bbchop ===
* ''bbchop'' ([http://github.com/Ealdwulf/bbchop github]) by Ealdwulf Wuffinga is a tool for bisecting on an intermittent bug, using Bayesian decision theory.

=== gitolite ===
* ''gitolite'' ([http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite]), by Sitaram Chamarty, (sitaramc at gmail), is inspired by gitosis, plus an urgent need to manage per-branch permissions. It is written entirely in perl, and designed to be usable on any Unix machine that managed to install git and perl. It does not require root access to install or use.
* Other advantages: an "easy install" script + copious documentation to make things as painless as possible, especially with the critical ssh pieces; simpler, yet more powerful config file syntax; ability to split the config into parts and delegate authority to different people; better logging helps figure out exactly what was allowed/denied and why; "personal" branch namespace for developers.  Also there's a version that allows "deny" in the access control list, making it truly powerful for pretty much all sorts of access restriction needs

=== Girocco ===
* ''girocco'' ([http://repo.or.cz/w/girocco.git http://repo.or.cz/w/girocco.git]) by Petr Baudis is a Git project hosting framework, powering e.g. the repo.or.cz hosting site. It supports project forking, both mirror and push project modes, is highly configurable and flexible, but contains just the essential features. It is suitable both for public hosting and intranet Git hosting sites for developers' cooperation within closed shops.
