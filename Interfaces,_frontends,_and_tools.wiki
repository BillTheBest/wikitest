= Frontends and Interfaces =

== Version Control Interface layers ==

<b><u>Core Git</u></b> (in distribution)::
    Core Git contains a set of script on the top of [[Git]] plumbing, providing version control system interface, distributed along the Git itself. It is quite powerful, but rather unfriendly.

<b>Cogito</b><<Anchor(Cogito)>>::
    [[Cogito]] is the most popular version control system on top of Git. It aims at seamless user interface and ease of use, providing generally smoother user experience than the "raw" Git interface and indeed also many other version control systems.

<b>StGIT (Stacked Git)</b><<Anchor(StGIT)>>::
    [[StGIT]] ([http://www.procode.org/stgit/ homepage]) provides a Quilt-like patch management functionality (i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) in the Git environment. You can easily manage your patches in the scope of Git until they get merged upstream. <<BR>>
    <b>See also</b>: [http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/ Quilt project page].

<b>Patchy Git (pg)</b><<Anchor(pg)>>::
    [[pg]] ([http://www.spearce.org/category/projects/scm/pg/ homepage]) by Shawn Pearce aims to help the user manage a set of patches on top of the current branch. pg is somewhat like Quilt or StGIT, but it does have a slightly different feature set.

<b>IsiSetup</b><<Anchor(isisetup)>>::
    [http://www.isisetup.ch/ IsiSetup] (APT for your config) is a utility to help managing your configuration files with Git as backend.  You can rollback changes, explore the history of changes, replicate your configuration, backup your configuration and blame changes to admins.

== Graphical Interfaces ==

<b>(h)gct</b><<Anchor(hgct)>>::
    [[(h)gct]] ([http://www.cyd.liu.se/~freku045/gct/ homepage]) by Fredrik Kuivinen is a GUI enabled commit tool. It has support for both Git and Mercurial. Writtent in PyQt.

<b>tig (Text-mode Interface for Git)</b><<Anchor(tig)>>::
    [[tig]] ([http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/ homepage]) by Jonas Fonseca is a simple git repository browser written using ncurses. Basically, it just acts as a front-end for `git-log` and `git-show`/`git-diff`. Additionally, you can also use it as a pager for git commands.

<b>QGit</b><<Anchor(qgit)>>::
     [[QGit]] ([http://digilander.libero.it/mcostalba/ homepage]) is a Qt GUI for browsing the history of Git repositories. It also acts as a commit tool, like [[#hgct (h)gct]] and as a graphical interface to [[#StGIT StGIT]].

<b><u>gitk</u></b> (distributed with Git)<<Anchor(gitk)>>::
    [[gitk]] is a simple Tcl/Tk GUI for browsing history of Git repositories easily, distributed with Git.

<b>gitview</b> (in `contrib/`)<<Anchor(gitview)>>::
     [[GitView]] is a GTK based repository browser for git written in Python by Aneesh Kumar K.V. It  can be found in `contrib/` directory of Git source tree.

== Web Interface ==

<b><u>gitweb</u></b> (distributed with Git)<<Anchor(gitweb)>>::
    [[gitweb]] provides full-fledged web interface for Git repositories. It is written in Perl and was maintained by Kay Sievers; from git version 1.4.0 it is distributed with Git.  Used at [http://www.kernel.org/git/ kernel.org].

    The [http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/index.php/Main_Page XMMS2 project] maintains their own version of gitweb which has some additional features. The latest snapshot of this effort can be downloaded from [http://git.xmms.se/?p=gitweb-xmms2.git;a=summary].

<b>wit</b><<Anchor(wit)>>::
    [[wit]] ([http://www.grmso.net:8090/ homepage]) is a Python implementation maintained by Christian Meder.

<b>gitarella</b><<Anchor(gitarella)>>::
    [http://flameeyes.is-a-geek.org/projects#gitarella gitarella] ([http://freshmeat.net/projects/gitarella/ freshmeat project page]) is a Ruby-based Git web frontend, created and maintained by Flameeyes. It is inspired by and following the style of gitweb. It supports CGI and FastCGI interfaces. See it in work on [http://git.flameeyes.is-a-geek.org/gitarella/ gitarella repository].

<b>gittracker</b><<Anchor(gittracker)>>::
    [http://www.tglx.de/cgi-bin/gittracker/about git tracker] by Thomas Gleixner is a GPL licenced project to track the history of Git repositories.

= Tools =

== Editors and IDE integration ==

<b>Emacs integration</b> (in `contrib/`)<<Anchor(git.el)>>::
    Preliminary Emacs mode for Git from Alexandre Julliard (in `contrib/emacs` directory) consist of `git.el` which is project tree browser similar to pcl-cvs, and `vc-git.el` which is VC backend.<<BR>>

    There is also a project,  [http://download.gna.org/dvc/ DVC] (Distributed Version Control), on Gna!, by the authors of Xtla, to create a generic library for fancy Emacs interfaces to modern version control systems. Currently it supports [http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/ GNU Arch] (<i>tla</i>) and [http://freshmeat.net/projects/baz/ Bazaar] (<i>baz</i>), and has initial support for [http://bazaar-vcs.org/ Bazaar-NG] (<i>bzr</i>) and [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/ Mercurial] (<i>xhg</i>).

    <b>See also:</b> [[EmacsWiki/[[CategoryVersionControl]]|[[CategoryVersionControl]]] on [[EmacsWiki]]].

<<Anchor(rcs-interaction)>>
== Interaction with other Revision Control Systems ==

<b>Built-in import</b> (built in)<<Anchor(git-xxximport)>>::
    Core Git contains `git-xxximport` commands for importing from other systems: [http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/ GNU Arch] (`tla`), [http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/ CVS] (needs `cvsps`: [http://ydirson.free.fr/en/software/scm/cvsps.html CVSps patches]) and [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] (`svn`) (using `SVN::Perl` module), [https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/ Quilt] and [http://www.perforce.com/ Perforce] (`p4`). There exist also (dumb and slow) unpublished BitKeeper (`bk`) importer.

<b>git-cvsexportcommit</b> (built in)<<Anchor(git-cvsexportcommit)>>::
    `git-cvsexportcommit` exports a commit from Git to a CVS checkout, making it easier to merge patches from a git repository into a CVS repository. Supports file additions, removals, and commits that affect binary files.

<b>git-cvsserver</b> (built in)<<Anchor(git-cvsserver)>>::
    `git-cvsserver` is a CVS emulation layer for git. It is highly functional; the mapping is bidirectional, so people who like cvs, can do both checkout and commit using cvs, and it shows up in git. However, not all methods are implemented, and for those methods that are implemented, not all switches are implemented. Testing has been done using both the CLI CVS client, and the Eclipse CVS plugin. Most functionality works fine with both of these clients.

<b>parsecvs</b><<Anchor(parsecvs)>>::
    [http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=users-keithp-parsecvs;a=summary parsecvs] by Keith Packard is a C-based CVS file parser and Git import tool. It directly reads RCS ,v files (you can get them using CVSsuck if you don't have access to $CVSROOT) and generates a git-style rev-list structure from them. Repository available at git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/users/keithp/parsecvs

<b><u>git-svn</u></b> (built in)<<Anchor(git-svn)>>::
    [http://git-svn.yhbt.net/ git-svn] ([http://git.bogomips.org/git-svn.git git repository]), written by Eric Wong, is a simple conduit for bidirectional operation between a <i>single</i> Subversion branch and git. It is designed for developers who wish to contribute to projects that use Subversion, but would rather be using git.

<b>git-svnconvert</b><<Anchor(git-svnconvert)>>::
    git-svnconvert, written by Rutger Nijlunsing in Ruby, appeared only on git mailing list in post [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=git&m=114460050718696 |ANNOUNCE| git-svnconvert: YASI (Yet Another SVN importer)].

<b>git-ucmimport</b><<Anchor(git-ucmimport)>>::
    git-ucmimport, also written by Rutger Nijlunsing, is a converter from IBM Rational [[ClearCase]] UCM to git. The latest version can be found currently on [http://www.wingding.demon.nl]. In Ruby.

<b>Tailor</b><<Anchor(Tailor)>>::
    [http://www.darcs.net/DarcsWiki/Tailor Tailor] is an any-to-any version control system converter, with support for most free SCM. It was written by Lele and it is implemented in Python. Note that you need [http://www.darcs.net/DarcsWiki/Tailor/[[VersionOne]] /[[VersionOne]]], and it supports Git as target system only. Note also that as of 2006-02-21, it only supports linear histories and no branches.

<b>Darcs-Git</b><<Anchor(darcs-git)>>::
    [http://darcs.net/DarcsWiki/[[DarcsGit]] Darcs-Git] is an ongoing effort to make Darcs work with Git repositories, in particular the Linux kernel repository. It is now part Darcs-Unstable branch, available from http://abridgegame.org/repos/darcs-unstable

== Other tools ==

<b>colordiff</b> (in `contrib/`)<<Anchor(colordif)>>::
    [http://colordiff.sourceforge.net/ colordiff] by Dave Ewart (version modified specifically for Git is available in `contrib/`, to be removed) is a wrapper/replacement for 'diff' producing colourful output. Less usefull since <code><nowiki>--color</nowiki></code> option was added to [http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html git-diff(1)]. You can use it by assigning a filter to the environment variable, like so:
    <pre><nowiki>
export GIT_DIFF_PAGER="colordiff | less -RS"</nowiki></pre>

<b>gitcompletion</b> and <b>generate-completions</b><<Anchor(completion)>>::
    [http://www.hawaga.org.uk/ben/tech/gitcompletion/ gitcompletion] ([http://www.hawaga.org.uk/gitcompletion.git/ git repository]) by Ben Clifford is bash tab-completion for Git, gitk, Cogito (<i>cg</i>) and StGIT (<i>stg</i>). Cogito has the cogito bits of the above already included. There is also `generate-completions.sh` by Johannes Schindelin, available on git mailing list archive [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=git&m=114515313911717 |FYI| generated completions]. <span style="font-size: smaller">Yet another StGIT completions by Paolo Giarrusso, aka Blaisorblade are available at  [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=git&m=113025114026388 Re: latest stg/git commandline completions code]</span>.

<b>CIAbot</b><<Anchor(ciabot)>>::
    [http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=cogito/cogito.git;a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=contrib/ciabot.pl ciabot.pl] by Petr Baudis in `contrib/` directory in [[Cogito]] and [http://dev.gentoo.org/~ferdy/stuff/ciabot.bash ciabot.bash] by Fernando J. Pereda are scripts meant to run either on a post-commit hook or in an update hook. They send a git log message to [http://cia.navi.cx/ CIA] (system for tracking open-source projects in real-time). <<BR>>
    <b>See:</b> [http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/cogito cogito at CIA].

<b>git2rss</b><<Anchor(git2rss)>>::
    [http://bent.latency.net/git2rss git2rss] by Bennett Todd is a Perl script to generate an RSS summary of a git repo. Currently to be used rather as example. Similar to [http://darcs.simplicidade.org/repos/darcs2rss/darcs2rss darcs2rss].

<b>log remapper</b><<Anchor(remapper)>>::
    [http://www.linux.org.uk/pub/people/viro/remapper/ remapper] by Al Viro, announced in [http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=git&m=114756555630327 Re: |RFC| Add "rcs format diff" support], is a tool to (re)map position (file name and line number) in one revision to corresponding position (file name and line number) in other revision.  E.g. user sends report "linux-2.6.16 with configuration XYZZY fails to compile with: `arch/wii/kernel/l33t.c:42:parse error`" and with the remap tool you can map the error report to the current commit's state, when that bit of code got moved around to `drivers/input/wii/l33tcontrol.c:31337`.  It also already very useful for log comparison, with the noise due to line number changes excluded.   Note that it's not just for build logs; the thing is useful for sparse logs, grep -n output, etc., etc.

<b>gitfs</b><<Anchor(gitfs)>>::
    [http://www.sfgoth.com/~mitch/linux/gitfs/ GitFS] is a FUSE-based filesystem for working with source trees stored in git repositories.  The eventual goal is to provide a convenient way to work with lots of branches and patches.  Currently (pre-release version 0.03) only very basic  functionality is implemented - read-only access to the existing tags and objects.

<b>Nico Schottelius scripts</b><<Anchor(schottelius)>>::
    Some of [http://unix.schottelius.org/scripts/ Nico Schottelius (unix|linux) scripts] deal with Git: `db-dump+git.sh`, `update-gitweb.sh`, `update-git+cogito.sh`.
