I have first heard about Git on [[http://kerneltrap.org/|KernelTrap]], during the BitKeeper fiasco.

My first patch to git was caused by the fact that I couldn't get git-logo.png from gitweb... and as they say the rest is history.  I contribute mainly to [[Gitweb]], a bit to autoconf stuff, some to documentation (including this wiki), and a little bit to core git.
